# Enhanced Health Condition Matching

## Overview

This enhancement addresses the issue where AI-generated health conditions might have slight misspellings or variations that prevent them from being matched to existing database records.

## Features

### 1. Fuzzy String Matching
- Uses `difflib.get_close_matches` for intelligent string similarity matching
- Configurable cutoff threshold (default: 0.6) for match quality
- Handles common misspellings like "oxydative_stress" → "oxidative_stress"

### 2. Enhanced AI Prompt
- Updated system prompt to emphasize exact matching requirements
- Clear instructions to use exact condition_id values from the provided list
- Fallback handling for conditions not in the database

### 3. "Other Conditions" Section
- Unmatched conditions are displayed in a separate "Additional Conditions" section
- These conditions are still considered when creating treatment plans
- Proper display name formatting (e.g., "oxidative_stress" → "Oxidative Stress")

### 4. Treatment Plan Integration
- Other conditions are included as context when generating treatment plans
- Ensures comprehensive treatment recommendations

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions

#### `find_closest_condition_id(condition_name, valid_condition_ids, cutoff=0.6)`
- Performs fuzzy string matching to find the closest valid condition ID
- Returns the matched ID or None if no match above the cutoff threshold

#### `condition_id_to_display_name(condition_id)`
- Converts condition IDs to proper display names
- Replaces underscores with spaces and capitalizes words

#### `match_conditions_with_fallback(ai_conditions, valid_condition_ids)`
- Main function that processes AI-returned conditions
- Returns tuple of (matched_conditions, other_conditions)

### Data Flow

1. **AI Analysis**: AI returns conditions with potential misspellings
2. **Matching**: System attempts to match each condition to valid database records
3. **Fallback**: Unmatched conditions are placed in "other_conditions" section
4. **Display**: Both matched and other conditions are shown to users
5. **Treatment Planning**: All conditions (matched + other) are considered for treatment plans

### Quiz Completion Logic

- Only matched conditions that require quizzes are counted for completion
- Other conditions don't require quizzes and don't block progression
- Users can proceed to treatment plans once all matched condition quizzes are completed

## Example Usage

```python
# AI returns conditions with potential misspellings
ai_conditions = [
    {'condition_id': 'oxydative_stress', 'level_of_risk': 'High'},
    {'condition_id': 'iron_deficiency_anemia', 'level_of_risk': 'Medium'},
    {'condition_id': 'heart_disease', 'level_of_risk': 'Low'}
]

# Valid condition IDs from database
valid_ids = ['oxidative_stress', 'iron_deficiency_anemia', 'vitamin_d_deficiency']

# Match with fallback
matched, other = match_conditions_with_fallback(ai_conditions, valid_ids)

# Result:
# matched = [
#     {'condition_id': 'oxidative_stress', 'original_ai_id': 'oxydative_stress', ...},
#     {'condition_id': 'iron_deficiency_anemia', ...}
# ]
# other = [
#     {'name': 'Heart Disease', 'original_id': 'heart_disease', ...}
# ]
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: No more lost conditions due to minor misspellings
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: All identified conditions are considered in treatment plans
3. **Robust Matching**: Handles various types of spelling variations and typos
4. **Clear Communication**: Users can see both matched and unmatched conditions
5. **Flexible Progression**: Other conditions don't block user workflow
