% Transferin saturation ,The % transferrin saturation index is a calculated value that tells how much serum iron is bound to the iron-carrying protein transferrin. A % transferrin saturation value of 15% means that 15% of iron-binding sites of transferrin is being occupied by iron. It is a sensitive screening test for iron deficiency anemia if it is below the optimal range. It is a sign of iron overload or too much iron in the blood if it is above the optimal range.,"The % saturation index is a calculated value that is a better index of iron saturation than transferrin levels by themselves. It is also said to be a more sensitive screening test for iron deficiency than either serum iron or TIBC alone. The classic pattern of iron deficiency shows a decreased serum iron and an increased TIBC. This will increase the unsaturated binding capacity of transferrin and decrease the percent of transferrin bound to iron. A % transferrin saturation of 15% or below is a classic finding in iron deficiency anemia. The % transferrin saturation is calculated using the following formula:

"1,25 Vitamin D (Calcitrol)","
Calcitriol, also known as 1,25(OH)2D, is the active form of vitamin D. This bioactive hormone is produced by enzymatic conversion of

25(OH)D, the circulating reservoir or ""storage"" form of vitamin D. While measurement of 25(OH)D is the most common method of

assessing vitamin D status, evaluation of 1,25(OH)2D may be indicated in certain circumstances including kidney disease,

cardiometabolic disorders, and in those with symptoms of vitamin D deficiency despite normal 25(OH)D, pregnancy. Low calcitriol

may be associated with bone disease, liver or kidney disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, pregnancy

complications, and oxidative stress. Elevated calcitriol may be related to excess calcium in the blood or urine, granulomatous

disorders, and signs of toxicity, including mental status changes, gastrointestinal disturbances, and dehydration.","The bioactive form of vitamin D is 1,25(OH)2D, a hormone called calcitriol, that must be produced in the body from 25(OH)D through a two-step process. The liver is responsible for the first hydroxylation that produces 25(OH)D from food or cutaneous sources, a magnesium-dependent enzymatic process. The second hydroxylation that produces active calcitriol also depends on magnesium and occurs primarily in the kidney (Gropper 2021). However, other cells and tissues can hydroxylate 25(OH)D to the active form, including bone, intestine, pancreas, prostate, platelets, and immune cells. In the immune system, calcitriol suppresses cytokine release, inflammation, and autoimmunity and supports innate immunity against pathogens (Sassi 2018). Calcitriol levels are tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate. It has a half-life of approximately 4 hours compared to the 25(OH)D form, which reflects reserve stores and has a half-life of approximately 2-3 weeks. Calcitriol is not considered the best indicator of vitamin D status and may not reflect a vitamin D deficiency. It can even be elevated with deficiency due to secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, measuring 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) may be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as disordered metabolism of 25(OH)D or phosphate, including kidney disease, phosphate-losing disorders, oncogenic osteomalacia, rickets, and granuloma-forming disorders such as sarcoidosis and lymphoma (Holick 2017). Emerging research suggests that measuring calcitriol may have additional benefits, including immune support, due to its direct antimicrobial and inflammation-modulating activities. A cross-sectional study of 300 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia found that 82% had vitamin D deficiency, defined as a 25(OH)D below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). In the study, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were lower in those requiring hospitalization and with longer lengths of stay. However, only a lower 1,25(OH)2D was associated with increasing pneumonia severity. Lower mean calcitriol was observed in those with respiratory, hepatic, renal, and cardiac comorbidities, though only renal comorbidities reached statistical significance with a mean 1,25(OH)2D of 34.1 pg/mL (81.84 pmol/L) (Peltz 2014). Research also reveals an association between calcitriol and increased incidence of metabolic syndrome, including significantly increased triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol, in a cross-sectional analysis of subjects who completed clinical trials for colorectal cancer. The lowest incidence of metabolic syndrome occurred in individuals with a mean calcitriol of 46.6 pg/mL (111.84 pmol/L) compared to a level below 33.2 pg/mL (79.68 pmol/L) (Bea 2015). Calcitriol is believed to inhibit the synthesis of renin in the kidney, which may account for the antihypertensive and organ-protective benefits attributed to vitamin D. In a cohort of 3,296 patients referred for coronary angiography, lower levels of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were associated with higher PTH levels and upregulated renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Activation of RAS is recognized as a possible cause of cardiovascular and kidney disease. In the study, a deficient level of 25(OH)D below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) correlated with a calcitriol level of 30.5 pg/mL (73.2 pmol/L); 25(OH)D of 20-30 ng/mL (50-75 nmol/L) correlated with calcitriol of 37.7 pg/mL (90.48 pmol/L); and 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL correlated with calcitriol of 41.7 pg/mL (100.08 pmol/L) (Tomaschitz 2010). Vitamin D regulates the genes that facilitate embryo implantation, control inflammation, and protect against infection; insufficiency is associated with several pregnancy complications. In one study of 322 pregnant Arabian women, the mean level of 1,25(OH)2D was below 35 pg/mL (84 pmol/L) in subjects with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, ectopic pregnancy, and premature membrane rupture compared to a mean of 111 pg/mL (266.40 pmol/L) in pregnant controls. Concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D are expected to increase over the pregnancy, and decreased levels were significantly associated with infection, inflammation, diabetes, and compromised kidney function. Measuring both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D would be prudent before and during pregnancy (Albahlol 2020). A calcitriol level above 45.83 pg/mL (110 pmol/L) was strongly associated with autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis, osoriasis, and lupus, in a study of 100 Canadians despite low levels of 25(OH) in some cases. Researchers suggest that bacterial metabolites associated with autoimmunity may interfere with the feedback mechanism that degrades excess 1,25(OH)2D, as well as possible vitamin D receptor dysregulation. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D above 45.83 pg/mL may warrant further investigation in those at risk for autoimmune disorders (Blaney 2009).",18.00 pg/Mol,72.00 pg/mol,43.20 pmol/L,172.80 pmol/L,35.00 pg/mol,55.00 pg/mol,84.00 pmol/L,132.00 pmol/L,,,"Bone disease Low 1,25(OH)2D is associated with increased bone turnover, reduced bone mineral density, increased fracture risk, and bone disorders, including osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and rickets. Cardiometabolic disorders Low 1,25(OH)2D may be associated with metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C, hypertension, and acute inflammatory disease. Chronic kidney or liver disease The liver and kidney are instrumental in converting 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D and serum levels will be decreased in the event of liver or kidney dysfunction. Vitamin D deficiency Low 1,25(OH)2D is associated with overt vitamin D deficiency which can be characterized by decreased calcium absorption, increased parathyroid hormone, bone disease, myopathy, immune dysregulation, infectious disease, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.","Autoimmune disorders Elevated 1,25(OH)2D may be a sensitive marker of autoimmune disease, especially above 45.83 pg/mL (110 pmol/L), levels that correlate with the presence of multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and lupus, even in the absence of inflammation or low serum 25(OH) vitamin D. Hypercalcemia Elevated active 1,25 vitamin D increases calcium absorption and can lead to elevated calcium in the blood as well as increased calcium excretion and risk of related kidney stones. Chronic disease Elevated 1,25(OH)2D may be observed with chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibnomyalgia, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets. Granulomatous disorders, lymphoma Abnormal, excess production of 1,25(OH)2D can occur with lymphoma and granulomatous disorders. Chronic granulomatous disease is an immune deficiency disorder that impairs the function of phagocytic white blood cells, i.e., neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and monocytes. The disruption to first-line immune defense results in recurrent and potentially life-threatening infections. Vitamin D toxicity Excess vitamin D supplementation or abnormally increased production of 1,25(OH)2D can lead to vitamin D intoxication characterized by elevated calcium in the blood, increased calcium excretion in the urine, and nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposits in the kidney). Symptoms of toxicity include abdominal pain, vomiting, confusion, apathy, increased water intake, urine excretion, and dehydration.",,,,,,,

The results reflect the ability of the body to regulate blood glucose levels. Low levels of 1,5-AG reflect fairly frequent occurrences of high blood glucose in the past 1-2 weeks and may be suggestive of an increased risk of pre-diabetes, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease","1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a glucose-like monosaccharide found in many foods, is normally reabsorbed by the kidneys when blood glucose is normal. However, when glucose exceeds 160-180 mg/dL it competes with 1,5-AG for reabsorption, causing 1,5-AG to be excreted in the urine, reducing its level in the blood. Levels of 1,5-AG negatively correlate with fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, and HbA1C with strong statistical significance. A 1,5-AG below 10 ug/mL reflects fairly frequent occurrences of hyperglycemia exceeding 160-180 mg/dL in the past 1-2 weeks. These blood sugar spikes are likely to occur following a meal. Measuring 1,5-AG may be preferred to measuring HbA1C which does not detect frequent glucose fluctuations and is affected by hemoglobinopathies. A low 1,5-AG is associated with atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, as well as diabetes. The GlycoMark® test is used to detect blood levels of 1,5-AG.

Active B12,Active B12 is the form of circulating vitamin B12 that is readily available to tissues. Decreasing levels of Active B12 suggests a developing B12 deficiency.,"Active B12, (also known as holotranscobalamin, holoTC, holo TCIl, or transcobalamin II-bound), is the form of circulating vitamin B12 that is readily available to tissues. It represents only 10-30% of the total B12 in the blood but is the best biomarker for determining early phases of vitamin B12 deficiency. Individuals may be asymptomatic and have normal levels of total vitamin B12 but have decreasing levels of Active B12 which suggests a developing B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential to DNA synthesis, amino acid metabolism, nerve cell integrity, neurotransmitter synthesis, folate metabolism, and homocysteine processing, Its deficiency or insufficiency can have wide-reachina consequences.

Malabsorption of B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor results in the autoimmune condition known as pernicious anemia despite adequate intake. A deficiency or insufficiency of B12 will lead to megaloblastic (macrocytic) anemia. B12 deficiency Active B12 will be low in the case of frank vitamin B12 deficiency due to increased requirements, inadequate intake, or impaired absorption. A decreased Active B12 is considered the earliest marker for B12 deficiency followed by an increased methylmalonic acid level. A deficiency of B12 also leads to an increase in folate requirements due to folate trapping. Vitamin B12 deficiency may be prevalent in older adults or individuals following a vegetarian diet and should be assessed for and monitored closely. Cardiovascular risk cardiovascular disease. Levels of Active B12 correlate inversely with homocysteine levels. Elevated homocysteine is an independent risk factor for Drug-induced depletion Some medications can deplete vitamin B12 and reduce serum levels of Active B12 including oral contraceptives, metformin, proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers, and chemotherapy. Other medications may contribute to acute malabsorption leading to a short-term decrease in Active B12. Genetic variant Genetic variants in the transcobalamin gene (TCN2) may lead to a transcobalamin deficiency or an altered protein that is unable to bind to cells to deliver B12. Such variations may yield falsely low Active B12 levels. Additional assessment of B12 status, including homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels, should be conducted. One variant studied (rs35838082 (p.R215W) is rare in Caucasians but more common in individuals of South Asian or African origin. Inflammation Vitamin B12 modulates inflammation. An increase in inflammatory markers may be seen when B12 is deficient. Neurological Neurological consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency include brain atrophy, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive decline. These negative effects may be partially due to elevated homocysteine levels caused by vitamin B12 insufficiency.","Excess intake or reduced excretion An excessive intake of vitamin B12 (more than 1000 ug/day) or decreased excretion due to renal impairment may lead to increased levels of Active B12. However, in the case of renal patients, an increase in circulating Active B12 is believed to be required to maintain appropriate levels of methylmalonic acid. Elevated B12 levels B12 may be significantly elevated in malignancy, liver dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, or immune dysfunction. The increase in B12 may be due to increased production or release of haptocorrin, or another pathological process.

Adiponectin,"Adiponectin is a protein hormone secreted by fat cells. It regulates glucose metabolism, helps burn fat for energy, enhances appetite/food intake, and is inversely correlated with body fat and BMI.

ADMA,"Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a metabolite of the amino acid arginine. It is capable of inhibiting the conversion of arginine to nitric oxide, an important ""anti-atherogenic"" molecule. Nitric oxide is crucial to endothelial function and its deficiency contributes to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.
","ADMA inhibits nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme that converts arginine to NO. This inhibition leads to a deficiency of NO which, in turn, leads to endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium serves as a barrier between the bloodstream and the artery wall. Its major functions include the regulation of blood pressure and blood clotting, as well as the regulation of immunity.
Elevated ADMA levels are associated with increased risk of endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, insulin resistance, diabetes, and pre-diabetes. Early detection of elevated
ADMA may help identify these conditions prior to full clinical presentation.
Detection of elevated ADMA and/or SDMA should be followed up with a screening for diabetes/pre-diabetes.
Lifestyle changes that can help reduce ADMA and SDMA levels and support endothelial function include maintaining a healthy weight; engaging in regular exercise; consuming more fruits and vegetables; limiting or avoiding processed foods high in sugar and/or salt; and controlling cholesterol and blood pressure.

Albumin,"Albumin is one of the major blood proteins. Produced primarily in the liver, Albumin plays a major role in water distribution and serves as a transport protein for hormones and various drugs. Albumin levels are affected by digestive dysfunction and a decreased albumin can be an indication of malnutrition, digestive dysfunction due to HCI need (hypochlorhydria), or liver dysfunction.
Malnutrition leads to a decreased albumin level in the serum primarily from lack of available essential amino acids. Decreased albumin can also be a strong indicator of oxidative stress and excess free radical activity. Increased albumin is a strong indicator of dehydration.
","Serum albumin levels and its production are greatly affected by the health and function of the liver, because albumin is produced almost entirely by the liver. Liver dysfunction will cause a decreased albumin level.
Albumin is responsible for about 80% of the colloid-osmotic pressure between blood and tissue fluids. When albumin is decreased, osmotic pressure is disturbed and fluid can leak into intracellular spaces, leading to edema.
The main cause of an increased albumin level is dehydration.",3.6,5.1,36,51,4.5,5,45,5,g/dL,g/L,"Hypochlorhydria
A decreased albumin level is often associated with a decreased production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach (hypochlorhydria).
Hypochlorhydria is associated with an increased globulin level and a normal or decreased total protein and/or albumin, an increased BUN, a decreased or normal total protein and/or albumin and/or decreased serum phosphorous. Other values that may be reflective of a developing or chronic hypochlorhydria include increased or decreased gastrin, an increased MCV and MCH, a decreased or normal calcium and iron, a decreased chloride, and a decreased alkaline phosphatase.
Liver dysfunction
Albumin is produced almost entirely by the liver and dysfunction in the liver will have a great impact on albumin production and serum albumin levels. Therefore, a decreased albumin level may be indicative of a liver dysfunction that prevents the synthesis and formation of protein. A decreased albumin may be observed before any changes in liver enzymes are noted. Functionally oriented liver problems, such as detoxification issues, liver congestion, and conjugation problems are extremely common and should be evaluated based upon early prognostic indicators. The liver should always be viewed in the context of the hepato-biliary tree. Some of the key clinical indicators include:
• Pain between shoulder blades
• Stomach upset by greasy foods
O If drinking alcohol, easily intoxicated
• Headache over the eye
• Sensitive to chemicals (perfume, cleaning solvents, insecticides, exhaust, etc.)
• Hemorrhoids or varicose veins
Oxidative Stress
Oxidative stress should be investigated if albumin levels are decreased along with a decreased lymphocyte count, a total cholesterol that is suddenly below its historical level, an increased total globulin an increased uric acid and low platelet levels (<150). Oxidative stress can cause an increased destruction of red blood cells; in these situations you may see an elevated bilirubin level.
Inflammation
Albumin decreases with inflammation, especially systemic inflammation due to decreased synthesis and increased degradation.
Vitamin C need
Albumin will frequently be decreased along a decreased HCT, HGB, MCH, MCHC, and serum iron. There will also be an increased MCV, alkaline phosphatase, and fibrinogen.
Pregnancy
A decreased albumin reading is considered normal in pregnancy.

Hyperaldosteronism may be suspected if levels don't decrease following a challenge with sodium or aldosterone-suppressing medications.","Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid the adrenal cortex produces from the precursor pregnenolone, a cholesterol derivative (Craig 2021). Aldosterone production is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and stimulated by low serum sodium, high serum potassium, and to some extent, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Aldosterone helps maintain serum sodium and potassium levels and plasma volume by increasing renal retention of sodium and water and renal excretion of potassium. Increased serum aldosterone may be caused by primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism. Non-adrenal secondary hyperaldosteronism may occur with low salt intake, hyponatremia due to diuretic or laxative use, potassium loading, renal vascular stenosis, malignant hypertension, pregnancy, hypovolemia, certain medications, and edematous conditions, including congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and cirrhosis (Pagana 2022). Under acute stress and increased aldosterone, the sodium-to-potassium ratio in the blood may increase due to sodium retention and potassium loss (Wardle 2019).
Aldosterone levels, in general, are influenced by diurnal variations, pregnancy, diet, posture, upright positioning, and supine positioning, which yields notably lower results. In adults, aldosterone levels range from 5-30 ng/dL (0.14-0.80 nmol/L, 138.70-832.20 pmol/L) in the upright position, while lower levels are seen when measuring in the supine position, i.e., 3-10 ng/dL (0.083-0.277 nmol/L, 83.22-277.40 pmol/L) (Pagana 2022).
Screening for hyperaldosteronism typically involves measuring serum aldosterone after a challenge with sodium, salt, or medications that suppress aldosterone levels. Healthy individuals will maintain serum aldosterone below 15 ng/dL (0.416 nmol/L, 416 pmol/L) following the challenge, whereas a persistently higher level may indicate hyperaldosteronism (Dominguez 2023).
However, some researchers suggest that serum aldosterone persistently above 10 ng/dL (0.277 nmol/L, 277.40 pmol/L) following a sodium challenge has a high probability of being associated with primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) and should be evaluated further (Shidlovskyi 2019). Researchers note that aldosterone variability may be substantial in those with and without aldosteronism, and repeat testing is indicated. Some individuals with confirmed PHA may have an aldosterone result below 10 ng/dL (0.277 nmol/L, 277.40 pmol/L), leading researchers to consider ""more permissive screening recommendations for primary hyperaldosteronism"" (Yozamp 2021).
Primary hyperaldosteronism is an adrenal disorder characterized by unregulated aldosterone production resistant to chemical suppression. It is most commonly due to adrenal hyperplasia or tumor secretion, especially from an adenoma. Sodium retention, potassium excretion, hypokalemia, hypertension, and suppressed plasma renin are observed in this disorder. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines, indicate that PHA is a public health issue that should be screened for regularly, especially in those with hypertension (Hanna 2016). The prevalence of primary aldosteronism may be as high as 30% in those with resistant hypertension (Yozamp 2021).
The risk of atrial fibrillation, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke is much higher in hypertensives with PHA than without it. The risk of kidney damage increases with hyperaldosteronism as well. A persistently elevated upright aldosterone above 19.83 ng/mL (0.550 nmol/L, 550.08 pmol/L) in conjunction with undetectable renin and spontaneous hypokalemia likely indicates primary hyperaldosteronism. However, lower aldosterone levels may be present in PAH, and high-risk individuals should be evaluated further, especially with aldosterone of 15 ng/dL (0.416 nmol/L, 416 pmol/L) or above. Additional testing includes plasma aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR), urine aldosterone, and other confirmatory tests (Funder 2016). The ARR test is the most sensitive approach to differentiating primary from secondary hyperaldosteronism (Pagana 2022).
A prospective study of 71 subjects with resistant hypertension revealed a significantly higher median aldosterone in subjects compared to controls: 11 ng/dL (0.305 nmol/L, 305.14 pmol/L) versus 5.5 ng/dL (0.153 nmol/L, 152.57 pmol/L), respectively. Higher aldosterone was also significantly associated with obstructive sleep apnea in hypertensive subjects (Pratt-Ubunama 2007).
A low-salt diet can stimulate aldosterone production by activating the sympathetic nervous system. A study of 152 healthy subjects found that a low-salt diet was associated with significantly increased serum aldosterone with a mean of 21 ng/dL (0.583 nmol/L, 582.54 pmol/L) in those on a low-salt diet versus 3.4 ng/dL (0.094 nmol/L, 94.32 pmol/L) on a high-salt diet. Researchers associated a low-salt diet with insulin resistance in this cohort (Garg 2011).
Data from 4,095 African American subjects participating in the prospective Jackson Heart Study found that optimizing Life's Simple 7 (LS7) metrics was associated with a significant and beneficial decrease in aldosterone. The LS7 categories include four health behaviors (smoking, dietary intake, physical activity, BMI) and three health factors (total cholesterol, fasting glucose, and blood pressure) (Kesireddy 2019).",0,28,0,0.78,4,14,0.11,0.39,ng/dL,nmol/L,"Addison's Disease

High Salt Intake
A diet high in salt or sodium can suppress aldosterone production.
Licorice Intake
Licorice has an aldosterone-like effect and excess intake can reduce serum aldosterone resulting in sodium and water retention and urinary potassium loss.","
Edema
Elevated aldosterone is associated with edematous states, including congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and cirrhosis.
Primary Aldosteronism
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is most often caused by an adrenal tumor or hyperplasia which stimulates the production of aldosterone. PA is often accompanied by high blood pressure, low serum potassium, weakness, and polyuria.
Secondary Aldosteronism
Secondary aldosteronism is caused by nonadrenal issues, including hyponatremia due to low-salt intake, use of diuretics or laxatives; potassium loading; pregnancy or estrogen use; hypovolemia, renal vascular stenosis or occlusion; malignant hypertension; and edematous states including congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome.
Stress, Anxiety, Depression
Higher aldosterone is associated with stress, anxiety, and depression. Stress itself can stimulate adrenocortical secretion and increase serum aldosterone.
Sleep Apnea
Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with significantly higher aldosterone in hypertensive subjects.
Strenuous Exercise
Strenuous or excessive exercise can increase aldosterone levels by increasing adrenocortical secretions.
Hyperkalemia
High serum potassium levels stimulate production of aldosterone which will cause a loss of potassium in the urine along with a retention of sodium and water.
Hyponatremia
Low serum sodium stimulates the production of aldosterone resulting in increased sodium retention and levels in the serum. The increase in aldosterone concurrently causes an increased loss of potassium in the urine.
Low Salt Intake
A low-salt diet can activate the sympathetic nervous system and increase aldosterone production, resulting in increased sodium and water retention and potassium excretion.",,,,,,"

Alk Phos,"
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a group of isoenzymes that originate in the bone, liver, intestines, skin, and placenta. It has a maximal activity at a pH of 9.0-10.0,

hence the term alkaline phosphatase. Decreased levels of ALP have been associated with zinc deficiency. Elevated levels of ALP in the serum can occur with any

liver dysfunction, it is especially sensitive to any type of obstruction in the biliary tract, both intra and extra-hepatic, both severe and mild. The degree of

ALP elevation is in direct correlation to the severity of the obstruction. Elevated levels not of liver origin are seen in normal bone growth in children and healing
fractures.","ALP is a member of the metaloprotein family of enzymes that remove phosphate from organic phosphate esters. Metaloenzymes are zinc dependent for their optimal function, and decreased levels of ALP have been associated with zinc deficiency.
The total ALP level is composed of fractions of ALP isoenzymes. Each of these isoenzymes can be fractionated by electrophoresis into their constituent fraction.
In the liver, ALP is formed by liver and biliary mucosal cells, and is excreted in the bile by a mechanism that is different than bilirubin excretion.
The most common liver causes of increased serum ALP include extra-hepatic or common bile duct obstruction, intra-hepatic biliary tract obstruction that is usually caused by acute damage to the liver cells (viral hepatitis, active cirrhosis), and space-occupying tumors in the liver, especially metastatic tumors of the liver. Mild elevations of ALP may be seen in patients with fatty liver. Abnormal elevations are seen in diseases of the bon€
Elevations of ALP have been associated with drug-induced liver damage and are a sign that a drug toxicity reaction is occurring. ALP of bone origin is the most common extra-hepatic source of increased ALP levels. Large amounts of ALP are produced by osteoblastic activity in the bone, which is usually seen in normal bone growth in children and healing fractures. Abnormal elevations are seen in diseases of the bone that have hyperactivity in osteoblastic activity and in metastatic carcinoma from a number of different organs that metastasize to the bone.
Any patient who has a significantly elevated total serum ALP should be followed up with an ALP isoenzyme study, which will help pinpoint the tissue involved in the total serum ALP increase.",35,150,35,150,45,100,45,100,IU/L,IU/L,"Zinc deficiency
Alkaline phosphatase is a zinc dependent enzyme. Decreased levels have been associated with zinc deficiency along with decreased WBC or RBC zinc levels and a low normal or decreased total WBC. Follow up a decreased alkaline phosphatase with a zinc taste test.
Magnesium deficiency
Decreased Alk phos levels have been associated with magnesium deficiency along with decreased serum and/or RBC magnesium levels.","Biliary Obstruction
Increased alkaline phosphatase along with an increased GGT is seen with biliary tree involvement. If the problem involves a biliary/common bile duct obstruction, the alkaline phosphatase and the GGT will generally be increased significantly above the ALT. If there is an actual stone or calculi the total bilirubin level will also be elevated.
Liver cell damage
If alkaline phosphatase levels are increased with increased total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, AST, GGT, and/or LDH liver dysfunction is probable. This may be caused by cellular damage, such as liver infection (hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, EBV, CMV, etc.), which should be ruled out.
Liver dysfunction due to drug toxicities and carcinoma of the liver
An increase in Alkaline phosphatase can be an indicator of liver dysfunction due to drug toxicities. Ask your patients about their prescription and nonprescription drug use. Elevated levels of ALP are often seen in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the liver, which will cause an increase in the liver fraction of
Vitamin C need
An increased Alkaline phosphatase level is associated with vitamin C need. Albumin will frequently be decreased along a decreased HCT, HGB, MCH, MCHC, serum iron. There will also be an increased MCV, alkaline phosphatase, and increased fibrinogen.
Bone disease causing bone loss or increased bone turnover
Alkaline phosphatase enzyme levels will often be increased in bone diseases, such as Osteomalacia / Rickets / Paget's disease / Rheumatoid arthritis / Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Bone growth and repair (fracture healing)
Alkaline phosphatase enzyme levels will often be increased in situations of normal bone growth and repair. Increased osteoblastic activity, along with calcium deposition in the bones will cause this increase.
Herpes Zoster (shingles)
Although best determined from a physical examination of the lesions, shingles will often result in an elevated ALP. With the inflammation of shingles, the sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and basophil count will often be increased, while the total WBC levels, viral titers, and ALT will often be normal.
Metastatic carcinoma of the bone
Due to the elevated bone destruction and attempts by the body to repair, elevated levels of ALP significantly above the reference range can occur in metastatic carcinoma of the bone from carcinomas of the prostate (70-90% of patients), breast (50% of patients), and about 30% of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the lung, kidney or thyroid.","• Hypothyroidism

Alpha-1 Globulin,"Alpha-1 globulin refers to a group of plasma proteins that migrate in the alpha-1 region on serum protein electrophoresis. The primary protein in this fraction is alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), a protease inhibitor responsible for neutralizing neutrophil elastase in the lungs. By preventing excessive elastase activity, ATAT protects alveolar structures from destruction. Because alpha-1 globulins are also acute-phase reactants, their levels often rise in response to inflammation, infection, or tissue injury.
","Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is a key concern when alpha-1 globulin levels are low. This autosomal codominant genetic disorder can lead to significant morbidity, most notably early-onset emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In severe cases (e.g., the PiZZ genotype), abnormal AIAT accumulates within hepatocytes, contributing to liver disease and potentially cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. While heterozygous individuals (e.g., PiMZ) may remain asymptomatic, they face an increased risk of lung pathology, especially if they smoke or have other environmental exposures that amplify neutrophil elastase activity.
Elevated alpha-1 globulin levels often indicate an acute-phase response. During episodes of inflammation, infection, or tissue damage, the body ramps up production of acute-phase proteins, including AAT, as a defensive measure. This temporary elevation can help protect tissues from proteolytic damage.
However, persistent or markedly elevated alpha-1 globulin may suggest chronic inflammatory or autoimmune processes. Clinicians should integrate these findings with other laboratory tests-such as CRP, ESR, and liver function tests-to discern whether an elevated alpha-1 fraction reflects a reactive, self-limiting phase or an underlying, ongoing inflammatory or neoplastic process.
When evaluating alpha-1 globulin abnormalities, it is also important to consider coexisting hepatic conditions, given that AIAT is synthesized in the liver. In patients presenting with unexplained liver dysfunction, measuring alpha-1 globulin (and, specifically, A1AT levels) can help reveal whether a hereditary deficiency or chronic inflammatory state is contributing to both hepatic and pulmonary complications. In these instances, genetic testing may confirm a specific ATAT phenotype, guiding long-term management strategies that include lifestyle interventions, augmentation therapy (where indicated), and vigilant monitoring for liver or lung damage.
Finally, you should be mindful that alpha-1 globulin assessment is a complement to, rather than a substitute for, targeted imaging and functional tests. Pulmonary function tests, chest imaging, and liver ultrasound or MRI can all shed light on the clinical significance of an abnormal alpha-1 globulin reading. By combining laboratory data with a thorough patient history and physical examination, you can better differentiate between transient inflammatory responses and inherited or chronic pathological conditions.",0,0.3,0,0.3,0.2,0.3,0.2,0.3,g/dL,g/dL,"Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
A genetic disorder leading to reduced AlAT production or abnormal protein accumulation, associated with early emphysema, COPD, and possible liver disease.
Severe Protein-Losing States
Profound malnutrition or protein loss through gastrointestinal or renal pathways may, in rare cases, lower alpha-1 globulin levels.","Acute Inflammation or Infection
The alpha-1 globulin fraction rises as part of the acute-phase response to injury, infection, or stress.
Chronic Inflammatory or Autoimmune Conditions
Persistent elevation of Alpha-1 Globulin may indicate ongoing inflammatory processes, requiring correlation with other markers.
Tissue Injury
Surgery, burns, or other forms of trauma can temporarily elevate alpha-1 globulin levels as the body attempts to limit proteolytic damage.",,,,,,,
Alpha-2 Globulin,"Alpha-2 globulin refers to a group of plasma proteins that migrate in the alpha-2 region during serum protein electrophoresis. Key components include haptoglobin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and ceruloplasmin, each of which carries out specialized functions in immune regulation, antioxidant defense, and nutrient transport. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin to prevent oxidative stress and preserve iron, alpha-2-macroglobulin functions as a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor, and ceruloplasmin is primarily responsible for copper transport and plays a role in iron metabolism. Because these proteins frequently act as acute-phase reactants, alpha-2 globulin levels may fluctuate in response to inflammation, infection, or tissue injury.","When alpha-2 globulin levels are low, conditions such as malnutrition, advanced liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome should be considered. In malnutrition, the body's limited protein resources can lead to reduced synthesis of these globulins, while significant hepatic dysfunction can impair their production altogether. In nephrotic syndrome, the kidney's damaged glomeruli allow proteins-including alpha-2 globulins-to be lost in the urine, leading to lower circulating levels. Clinicians should integrate findings from additional lab tests (e.g., liver enzymes, renal function tests, serum albumin) and the patient's clinical presentation to differentiate among these etiologies.
Elevated alpha-2 globulin, on the other hand, often reflects an acute-phase or chronic inflammatory state. During acute infections, inflammatory processes induce an upregulation of proteins such as haptoglobin and alpha-2-macroglobulin, helping to protect tissues from oxidative injury and regulate excessive protease activity. Persistently high alpha-2 globulin may signal ongoing conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorders. Reviewing concomitant inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, ESR) and correlating them with the patient's symptoms, imaging, or additional autoimmune panels can help narrow down the source of the elevation.
Because alpha-2 globulin encompasses multiple proteins with varied functions, further immunochemical testing or fractionation can pinpoint which specific proteins are driving the abnormal levels. For instance, selectively low haptoglobin might suggest hemolysis, while abnormally high ceruloplasmin might raise concerns about copper metabolism disorders. Such specificity can refine diagnostic accuracy and guide more targeted interventions. Ultimately, assessing alpha-2 globulin in tandem with alpha-1, beta, and gamma globulin fractions provides a more holistic view of a patient's immune status, inflammatory load, and hepatic synthetic function.",0.5,0.9,0.5,0.9,0.5,0.9,0.5,0.9,g/dL,g/dL,"Liver Disease

ALT,"
ALT is an enzyme present in high concentrations in the liver and to a lesser extent skeletal muscle, the heart, and kidney. ALT will be

liberated into the bloodstream following cell damage or destruction. Any condition or situation that causes damage to the

hepatocytes will cause leakage of ALT into the bloodstream. These include exposure to chemicals, viruses (viral hepatitis,

mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr, etc.), alcoholic hepatitis. The most common non-infectious cause of an increased ALT is


a condition called steatosis (fatty liver). ALT levels may be decreased in vitamin B6 deficiency and early stages of fatty liver.","Alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid L-alanine and a keto-glutarate into pyruvate and L-glutamate, hence the older name SGPT or Serum Glutamate-Pyruvate Transaminase.
ALT is functionally similar to AST; however, in liver problems, it is increased more than AST. ALT is more specific for the detection of biliary tree or liver problems than problems of cardiovascular origin. Levels originating from the liver are due to damage to the hepatocytes or liver cells.
ALT levels tend to take a long time to normalize after an elevation. This is in contrast to AST levels, which will normalize quite quickly after an elevation. This can be used clinically to differentiate a chronic from an acute problem.
ALT levels, due to its concentration in the hepatocytes, are key in monitoring situations that can cause damage to the liver e.g. exposure to chemicals, viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis",6,29,6,29,10,26,10,26,IU/L,IU/L,"B6 Deficiency
B6 deficiency is likely if there is a decreased ALT and a concomitant deficiency in GGT and/or AST, enzymes that also need B6 for optimum activity. B6 deficiency can also impact red blood cell activity leading to a decreased MCV/MCH with a normal serum iron and ferritin level. This situation leads to B6 deficiency anemia.
Fatty liver (steatosis) - early stage
A decreased ALT is associated with liver congestion and the early stage of fatty liver (steatosis). The early stage of fatty liver is possible if the ALT is decreased, the total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels are increased, and HDL levels are decreased.","Dysfunction located inside the liver
If the ALT is increased above the levels of the AST and GGT consider that the problem or area of involvement is possibly inside the liver.
Fatty liver (steatosis)
If the ALT is increased above the AST and GGT levels, liver dysfunction due to fatty liver is probable. Consider it more likely if the LDH and ALP levels are also increased. In advanced steatosis, the ALT levels can be elevated 4 times the upper limit of normal, accompanied by an elevation in AST. ALT is usually greater than the AST level.
Liver dysfunction
An increased ALT is associated with liver dysfunction. Dysfunction in the liver may cause an increase in ALT from hepatocytes.
Biliary tract obstruction
Suspect biliary tract obstruction when the ALT is elevated with increased GGT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and/or LDH.
Liver infection
When the ALT is elevated above the normal reference range or higher consider that there may be a liver infection. Hepatitis, CMV, EBV,
Infectious mononucleosis, etc. should be ruled out when the ALT is greatly elevated.
Excessive muscle breakdown or turnover
ALT may be elevated when there is excessive muscle breakdown. Conditions such as weight-training and muscular injury can cause elevated levels of ALT to appear in the bloodstream.

ALT : AST," The ALT:AST ratio compares the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), two key  hepatic enzymes. This ratio is an indicator of liver enzyme balance and potential metabolic derangements. An elevated ratio is  associated with a possible trend toward insulin resistance and emerging metabolic syndrome. A higher ratio may indicate increased  hepatic fat accumulation or early dysregulation in glucose and lipid metabolism. In such cases, evaluating the patient's broader  metabolic profile-including fasting glucose, lipid panels, and HbAlc-can help refine the risk assessment and inform preventative or  therapeutic strategies. A decrease in the ratio of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is not clinically   significant.","There is evidence that the ratio of ALT:AST is an indicator of emerging blood sugar dysregulation, especially the emergence of insulin resistance:
""In non-obese subjects, the best marker of insulin resistance was alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.77). In overweight subjects, AUC values for the ALT/AST ratio and ALT were 0.66 (0.59-0.72) and 0.66 (0.59-0.72), respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses for HOMA-IR showed that ALT/AST ratios were independently and significantly associated with HOMA-IR as well as other confounding factors in both non-obese and overweight subjects. The optimal cut-off point to identifying insulin resistance for these markers yielded the following values: ALT/AST ratio of ≥0.82 in non-obese subjects and ≥1.02 in overweight subjects.

An elevated ALT/AST ratio of greater than 1 was observed in a study of 60 subjects with metabolic syndrome. A positive correlation exists independently between fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR.

Apolipoprotein B,Apolipoprotein B (also called Apolipoprotein B-100) is a protein constituent of lipoproteins such as VLDL and LDL,"Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) facilitates the transport of lipids through the bloodstream. Apo B combines with dietary lipids to form the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein called VLDL. Over time as it travels through the blood, VLDL ""drops off"" its triglyceride content to become the cholesterol-rich lipoprotein known as LDL. Apo B has been reported to be a powerful indicator of Coronary Artery Disease. Apo B levels tend to mirror LDL levels so will be elevated when LDL cholesterol is elevated. Evaluation of Apo B levels can help assess cardiovascular risk and factors underlying elevated triglycerides.

AST,"AST is an enzyme present in highly metabolic tissues such as skeletal muscle, the liver, the heart, kidney, and lungs. This
enzyme is at times released into the bloodstream following cell damage or destruction. AST levels will be increased when liver
cells and/or heart muscle cells and/or skeletal muscle cells are damaged. The cause of the damage must be investigated. Low
levels are associated with a B6 deficiency.","Aspartate aminotransferase, or AST, is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid L-aspartate and a-keto-
glutarate into oxaloacetate and L-glutamate, hence the older name SGOT or Serum Glutamate-Oxaloacetate Transaminase.
AST is functionally similar to ALT, however, in liver problems, it is not as increased as ALT. AST is more specific for the
detection of problems of cardiovascular origin than for biliary tree or liver problems. Levels originating from the liver are due
to damage to the hepatocytes or liver cells.

AST levels in the blood due to severe cellular damage will usually increase in 12 hours and remain elevated for about 5 days.
In acute episodes, the AST levels will return to normal in 3-6 days.",10,35,10,35,10,26,10,26,IU/L,IU/L,"B6 Deficiency

B6 deficiency is likely if there is a decreased AST and a concomitant deficiency in GGT and/or ALT, enzymes that also need B6
for optimum activity. B6 deficiency can also impact red blood cell activity leading to a decreased MCV/MCH and a normal
serum iron and ferritin level. This situation leads to B6 deficiency anemia.","Dysfunction located outside the liver and biliary tree

If the AST is increased above the levels of the ALT and GGT consider that the problem or area of involvement is possible
outside the liver and biliary tree (i.e. the heart, gall bladder, common bile duct, and pancreas).

A developing congestive heart problem

An increased AST level can be an important clue to a developing congestive heart problem. Congestive heart disease (CHF) is
a very common cardiovascular disease so its helpful to use Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis to catch it before it fully
develops. If the AST is increased higher than an accompanying ALT increase with a normal to increased GGT, increased alkaline
phosphatase and a decreased CO2 consider the possibility of a developing congestive heart problem. It is more likely if the
patient also has an increased ESR, a normal to increased globulin and LDH, and an increased uric acid.

Cardiovascular insufficiency

Consider cardiovascular insufficiency if the AST is increased higher than an accompanying ALT increase with an increased CO2
and uric acid.

Liver dysfunction

An increased AST is associated with liver dysfunction. Dysfunction in the liver may cause an increase in AST from hepatocytes.
You may also see a rise in ALT as well.

Acute Myocardial Infarct

With a suspected or an acute MI, the AST is increased 4-10 times above the reference range, peaking after 24 hours and
normalizing after 3-4 days. Secondary rises in AST levels suggest a recurring MI or continued infarction.

Liver cell damage

Liver damage due to active cellular destruction (i.e. chronic/acute hepatitis, active cirrhosis, infectious mononucleosis, hepatic
necrosis, alcoholic hepatitis) will usually result in AST values 10-100 times above reference range.

Excessive muscle breakdown or turnover

AST is present in high concentrations in tissues with high metabolic activity, such as skeletal muscle. Conditions or situations
that cause cellular damage to skeletal muscle cells may cause an increased AST level (i.e. weight training injuries, trauma to
skeletal muscle, polymyositis).   Infectious mononucleosis, Epstein Barr and Cytomegalovirus

AST levels are usually elevated way above the normal reference level about 5-14 days after the onset of illness. Alkaline
phosphatase levels will also be elevated. LDH levels are usually elevated in about 95% of cases of. You may expect the

consumption is associated with increased AST/ALT ratio once liver damage has set in.

An increasing ratio of AST to ALT ratio above 1is associated with progressive impairment of liver function and associated
complications such as cirrhosis. An AST:ALT ratio of less than 1 was associated with less severe liver disease.

An AST/ALT ratio of 1 or more is significantly correlated with a reduction in hepatic detoxification and excretion capacity as
measured by the moncethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) test. The greater the AST/ALT ratio, the poorer the liver function.

Muscle damage

An elevated AST/ALT ratio above 1.67 is seen in the event of muscle damage as AST is found in significantly higher levels in
muscle than ALT is. Associated elevation in AST/ALT from muscle damage may be observed in critical limb ischemia (CLI) from
peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, and even strenuous exercise.

A ratio greater than 1 indicates cirrhosis has begun to develop; a ratio greater than 2 suggests the presence of alcoholic liver
disease, and a ratio of greater than 3 strongly suggests active alcoholic liver disease. The ratio may increase due to liver
fibrosis or reduced clearance of AST by specialized liver cells called sinusoidal cells.

Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP),"The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a mathematical calculation based on blood levels of triglycerides and HDL-C. The AIP
increases as triglycerides increase or HDL-C decreases. The AIP also reflects the size and atherogenicity of LDL particles and
increases as the size of LDL decreases. Small dense LDLs are the most dangerous type as they become oxidized, lodge inside
arteries, and promote inflammation and atherosclerosis. An elevated AIP is associated with cardiovascular disease and events,
dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, inflammation, and inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and severe
pancreatitis. A low AIP suggests a decreased risk of these chronic conditions.","The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is the logarithm of the triglyceride to HDL cholesterol ratio, a ratio that indirectly
reflects the size of LDL particles and the presence of small dense LDL cholesterol (sdLDL-C). Small dense LDL particles can
more easily infiltrate the artery wall and lead to oxidation of sdLDL cholesterol. This process promotes and accelerates
atherosclerosis, the leading cause of cardiovascular disease. The sdLDL-C has greater atherogenic potential than normal LDL
cholesterol due to its low affinity for LDL receptors, strong affinity for intima proteoglycans, slow clearance, and extended
retention time. Meta-analysis suggests that the AIP. a reflection of sdLDL-C and atherosclerosis risk, is an independent
predictor of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The strength of association increases when evaluated alongside LDL
cholesterol levels (Chen 2023).

The AIP also reflects the competence of the reverse cholesterol transport process which facilitates the recycling or disposal of
excess cholesterol. An increased AIP may be associated with increased arterial cholesterol crystal accumulation and adipose
tissue triglyceride accumulation. The AIP in the general population was evaluated in a retrospective study of 52,380
community residents 40 years of age or older from a single province in China. Higher AIP was associated with carotid artery
atherosclerosis, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and atherosclerotic plaque. Respectively, those with the highest
versus lowest AIP had mean triglycerides of 274 vs. 82 mg/dL (3.10 vs. 0.93 mmol/L); HDL-C 42 mg/dL vs. 64 mg/dL (1.09 vs.
1.66 mmol/L); LDL-C 104 vs. 99 mg/dL vs. 2.69 vs. 2.56 mmol/L), total cholesterol 189 vs. 178 mg/dL (4.9 vs. 4.6 mmol/L.. The
atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was defined as the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of fasting plasma triglyceride (TG)
(mg/dL) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [log (TG/HDL-C)] (Huang 2023). 

A higher AMI was associated with cardiometabolic risk in a retrospective study of 267 hospitalized AMI patients and 73
hospitalized controls. Subjects who had an AMI were significantly more likely to smoke and have diabetes, and had
significantly higher AIP, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and LDL-C, and significantly lower HDL-C. Mean values for those with an
acute MI included triglycerides 167 versus 129 mg/dL (1.89 vs. 1.46 mmol/L) with no MI, HDL-C 41 vs. 74 mg/dL (1.06 vs. 1.92
mmol/L), and fasting glucose 145 vs. 109 mg/dL (8.05 vs. 6.03 mmol/L) (Chen 2023).

The AIP can be considered a modifiable risk factor as nutrition and lifestyle changes can help improve triglyceride and HDL-C
levels and their underlying physiology. A 70-person cohort study observed significant improvements in AIP, triglycerides, and
HDL-C, as well as hemoglobin AIC, fasting glucose, insulin, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, vitamin D, total WBCs, absolute
neutrophils, RDW, ESR, fibrinogen, and hs-CRP with a 9-month program of health coaching, lifestyle changes, and nutrition
intervention (Lewis 2020).

Higher AIP is associated with inflammatory conditions and markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and
white blood cell counts. One cross-sectional study of 40 controls and 73 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a systemic
inflammatory disorder, found that an AIP above 0.21 was 4.99 times more likely to be associated with elevated hs-CRP of 2
mg/L or higher than those with an AIP below 0.21 (Dessie 2022). A prospective observational study of 323 pancreatitis
patients found that higher AIP was significantly associated with severe versus non-severe pancreatitis. Elevated AIP was also
associated with higher CRP, white blood cell counts, and BMI (Cho 2020).

Elevated AIP is considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A population-based cohort study of 514,866
individuals participating in a national screening program found that those with the highest AIP had a 28% higher risk of major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Those with the highest AIP had a mean triglyceride level of 262.9 versus 71.1 mg/dL
(2.97 vs. 0.80 mmol/L) and HDL-C of 42.3 vs. 68.1 mg/dL (1.09 vs. 1.76 mmol/L), compared to those with the lowest AIP. The
higher AIP was also associated with significantly higher fasting glucose and total cholesterol and lower estimated glomerular
filtration rate (Kim 2022).

Severe coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) was associated with significantly higher AIP,
mean triglyceride levels of 194 vs 154 mg/dL (2.19 vs. 1.74 mmol/L) and HDL-C of 41.26 vs. 47.25 mg/dL (1.07 vs. 1.22 mmol/L).
Those requiring CABG also had significantly higher incidence of peripheral artery disease, COPD, and diabetes (Celik 2021).
Research suggests that an AIP above 0.24 is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, AIP of 0.10 - 0.24 represents
medium risk, and an AIP below 0.1 represents the lowest CVD risk (Dobiasova 2006, Dobidsova 2017, Li 2021).",0.5,0.11,0.5,0.11,0.5,0.11,0.5,0.11,index,index,"Reduced Disease Risk
A low atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) usually indicates a favorable ratio of triglycerides to HDL-C and a lower risk of
atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and cardiometabolic disorders.","Cardiovascular Disease

An elevated atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) reflects dyslipidemia, indicating that triglycerides are too high, HDL-C is too
low, or both. It also reflects the likelihood of having small dense LDLs that are easily oxidized, damage the inside of arteries,
and promote atherosclerosis, the primary cause of heart disease. An elevated AIP is associated with major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE) and should be addressed promptly. Lifestyle and nutrition changes can help lower triglycerides
and raise HDL-C, favorably reducing the AIP.

Diabetes and Insulin Resistance

A high atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) usually indicates elevated triglycerides, a common sign of excess blood glucose that
gets converted to triglycerides. Blood glucose can build up when cells become resistant to insulin. A high AIP can also be due
to low HDL-C, a sign that cholesterol processing has become impaired. Low HDL-C can be associated with insulin resistance.
Dyslipidemia

Elevated atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) indicates an impairment of cholesterol and/or triglyceride processing. Cholesterol
must be transported back to the liver for processing by HDL. If this process is inadequate, cholesterol can build up and be
more likely to contribute to atherosclerosis and heart disease. Triglycerides may be elevated due to pancreatitis, diabetes,
other metabolic disorders, or excess intake of dietary fat, sugar, or alcohol. High triglycerides and/or low HDL-C will increase
the AIP and risk of cardiovascular disease.

Beta 1 Globulin,"Beta-1 globulin is one of the sub-fractions identified during serum protein electrophoresis, typically located in the “beta
region” but further distinguished from beta-2. This fraction comprises key proteins such as transferrin (the main iron transport
protein) and certain complement elements. Transferrin is integral to maintaining iron homeostasis, and the complement system
supports immune surveillance and defense. Because these components respond sensitively to changes in iron status and
inflammatory cues, beta-1 globulin levels can fluctuate in diverse clinical settings.","Low beta-1 globulin levels often suggest reduced synthesis of transferrin and other proteins in this fraction, or excessive
protein loss. In malnutrition, for instance, insufficient dietary intake can limit the amino acids required for protein production.
Advanced liver diseases—like cirrhosis—can diminish the organ’s capacity to synthesize plasma proteins, including transferrin.
Alternatively, renal disorders such as nephrotic syndrome may lead to significant urinary protein excretion, lowering the
concentration of various globulin fractions in the bloodstream.

High beta-1 globulin can indicate an acute-phase or chronic inflammatory response, which upregulates certain immune
proteins. One of the most common causes, however, is iron deficiency anemia. In this scenario, the body increases transferrin
production in an attempt to bind and transport any available iron efficiently. Chronic infections, autoimmune disorders, and
other inflammatory conditions can also drive up beta-1 globulin via both transferrin and complement components. Clinicians
typically correlate beta-1 levels with other lab findings—such as ferritin, transferrin saturation, CRP, and ESR—to identify
whether the primary driver is an inflammatory state, an iron metabolism issue, or both.

Ongoing assessment of beta-1 globulin levels can help track disease progression or treatment effectiveness. For instance, in
patients with iron deficiency, a reduction in beta-1 globulin after therapeutic intervention might reflect improved iron stores.
Similarly, in inflammatory or infectious processes, normalizing beta-1 levels may coincide with clinical resolution. Because beta-
1 globulin is only one fraction of the total protein profile, a comprehensive evaluation often includes alpha, beta-2, gamma
globulins, and albumin to gain a complete view of a patient's protein status.",0.4,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.4,0.6,g/dL,g/dL,"Malnutrition

Beta 2 Globulin,"Beta-2 globulin is one of the sub-fractions of the beta region visible on serum protein electrophoresis, comprising various
proteins with roles in iron transport (transferrin), immune regulation (complement components), and other protective
functions. Transferrin is essential for binding iron and distributing it to tissues, while complement proteins aid in immune
defense and inflammatory responses. Because these proteins respond to changes in inflammation, nutrition, and hematological
conditions, beta-2 globulin levels can vary widely in clinical practice.","A low beta-2 globulin reading may signal diminished protein synthesis or increased protein losses. When the liver struggles
with diseases such as cirrhosis or acute hepatitis, global protein production may fall, including proteins in the beta-2 fraction.
Alternatively, renal conditions (e.g., nephrotic syndrome) can lead to significant proteinuria, causing a reduction in circulating
globulins, including beta-2 proteins. Clinicians often compare beta-2 levels with other fractions (alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1,
gamma) and assess liver and kidney function tests to ascertain whether low beta-2 globulin is primarily due to hepatic
insufficiency or urinary protein loss.

A high beta-2 globulin can reflect both inflammatory and neoplastic processes. Chronic inflammation and autoimmune
diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus) can raise complement proteins, thereby elevating the beta-2 region. Hematologic
malignancies, most notably multiple myeloma, may also manifest as persistent or markedly elevated beta-2 microglobulin
(although beta-2 microglobulin is frequently measured separately via specialized assays). lron deficiency anemia is another
common cause of high beta-2 globulin, as the body attempts to ramp up transferrin production to capture any available iron.
To distinguish among these possibilities, physicians typically investigate iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation),
inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and, when warranted, specific assays for monoclonal proteins or imaging studies.
Understanding which proteins in the beta-2 fraction are driving an abnormal value allows more targeted evaluation. In patients
with suspected hemolysis or unusual immune activation, additional tests such as LDH, haptoglobin, or autoimmune panels may
be indicated. Conversely, if transferrin-driven elevations are confirmed, exploring dietary habits, gastrointestinal blood loss, or
malabsorption may clarify the presence of iron deficiency. By integrating beta-2 globulin data with comprehensive clinical and
laboratory findings, clinicians can differentiate among inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, or neoplastic causes.",0.2,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.5,g/dL,g/dL,"Hepatic Dysfunction

Beta Globulin,"Beta globulin is one of the major protein fractions identified on serum protein electrophoresis, typically positioned between
the alpha and gamma fractions. This region comprises several proteins, most notably transferrin (the primary iron transport
protein), certain complement components involved in immune defense, and beta-lipoproteins that transport lipids. Because
these proteins perform diverse roles—ranging from immune modulation to nutritional transport—beta globulin levels can shift
in a variety of clinical scenarios, including autoimmune disorders, chronic infections, and conditions affecting iron metabolism.","When beta globulin levels are abnormally low, the underlying causes frequently relate to a general reduction in protein
production or increased protein loss. Liver diseases that impair protein synthesis can lower multiple fractions, including beta
globulin. Similarly, kidney conditions that allow protein leakage (e.g., nephrotic syndrome) can lead to decreased levels across
multiple fractions. Nutritional deficits may further contribute to low beta globulin by limiting the availability of essential amino
acids for protein synthesis.

Conversely, elevated beta globulin levels often signal an immune or inflammatory response. Infectious processes and
autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis or SLE) can upregulate the production of certain beta globulin proteins,
notably complement components. Another reason for high beta globulin is iron deficiency anemia, where transferrin levels
increase in an effort to capture and transport as much iron as possible. Correlating beta globulin changes with other labs—
such as CRP, ESR, ferritin, and transferrin saturation—can help distinguish between inflammatory, infectious, and nutritional
etiologies. In some instances, fractionating beta globulins into beta-] and beta-2 provides additional clarity, pinpointing
whether LDL, transferrin, or complement proteins are primarily involved.

Monitoring beta globulin is clinically useful for tracking disease progression or therapeutic responses in chronic inflammatory
states and for detecting shifts in iron metabolism. However, it should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory data, given its broad range of proteins and potential for variability across different diseases.",0.7,1.3,0.7,1.3,0.7,1.3,0.7,1.3,g/dL,g/dL,"Liver Disease

Beta-2 Microglobulin,"Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) is a low-molecular-weight protein present on the surface of most nucleated cells, particularly
abundant in lymphocytes. B2M serves a role in the immune system by forming part of the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class | molecules, enabling cells to present antigens. It is freely filtered by the glomeruli in the kidneys and then largely
reabsorbed and catabolized by the proximal tubular cells. Consequently, conditions affecting either cellular turnover or renal
clearance can significantly alter B2M levels. Clinicians often measure serum B2M to evaluate disease activity, prognosis, and
treatment response in both renal and hematologic conditions.","Low serum B2M typically indicates minimal cell turnover or decreased immunologic activity. While not frequently identified as
a standalone pathological finding, it can appear in states of overall low metabolic activity, malnutrition, or certain
immunodeficiency disorders. In most cases, low B2M is not clinically significant unless correlated with other concerning
indicators of inadequate nutrition, immune compromise, or hepatic dysfunction.

High serum B2M, by contrast, is more commonly investigated. It is typically associated with increased cell turnover, immune
activation, or renal impairment. In chronic kidney disease, diminished filtration and tubular reabsorption can lead to elevated
serum B2M. Hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, frequently feature raised B2M levels because of increased
production and turnover of plasma or lymphoid cells. In lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma) and other
immune-related diseases (like rheumatoid arthritis or viral infections), B2M may also rise in concert with heightened immune
activity or tissue damage. B2M is often used as a prognostic marker in myeloma and other cancers, as higher levels can
indicate more aggressive disease or greater tumor burden.

Because B2M is both a reflection of cellular metabolic activity and renal function, interpretation should be integrated with tests
such as creatinine, eGFR, complete blood count, and imaging studies (e.g., skeletal surveys in suspected multiple myeloma). In
many scenarios, monitoring B2M levels over time provides insights into disease progression or therapeutic efficacy. For
instance, a declining B2M level in myeloma may indicate a positive response to chemotherapy, while persistently elevated
values might signal resistant or relapsing disease.",0,2.51,0,2.51,0,2.51,0,2.51,mg/L,mg/L,"Minimal Cell Turnover

BUN,"Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is a key biochemical marker reflecting protein metabolism and renal function. Urea, the primary
component measured by BUN tests, is formed in the liver as an end product of protein degradation and is subsequently
excreted by the kidneys. Elevated BUN levels can indicate renal impairment, where decreased kidney function leads to reduced
urea clearance. This elevation may also occur in conditions such as dehydration, which reduces renal blood flow and thus urea
excretion, or in states of increased protein catabolism, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, high protein diets, or severe
infections. Decreased BUN levels may be less clinically significant but can occur in scenarios such as severe hepatic damage
where urea production is compromised, malnutrition or overhydration, which dilutes the concentration of urea in the blood.
Monitoring BUN levels provides crucial insights into renal health and the body's protein metabolism state. It aids in diagnosing
kidney diseases, assessing the impact of certain drugs on renal function, and evaluating the nutritional status of patients,
particularly in the context of critical illness or chronic liver disease.","Urea is formed in the liver and is the final product in protein catabolism, along with CO2.

Unfortunately, when using blood chemistry analysis you can only make a judgment as to what is actually happening in the
kidney itself and speculate at best to the etiology and severity of the problem. Further kidney testing must be performed to
ascertain the nature of the problem.

Urea is removed almost entirely by the kidneys; however, a significant amount travels from the liver to the colon and is acted
upon by gut microflora to recirculate nitrogen, making it a useful indicator for dysbiosis. In the large intestine, the putrefactive
action of increased bacterial overgrowth on nitrogenous materials releases significant quantities of ammonia. Some of this
ammonia will be converted into urea by the liver leading to increased BUN levels.",7,25,2.5,8.92,10,16,3.57,5.71,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Diet- low protein

A decreased BUN level is associated with a diet that is low in protein. Low protein diets may show up with a decreased BUN

Malabsorption

A decreased BUN is associated with a chronic intestinal malabsorption, which is an inability of nutrients to be absorbed
through the intestinal wall. Malabsorption can lead to a functional protein deficit, which in turn will lead to lower levels of
protein catabolism and low BUN levels.

Pancreatic insufficiency

A decreased BUN is associated with a pancreatic insufficiency. A decreased level of digestive enzymes secreted from the

serum phosphorous, LDH, and AST. Suspected renal disease should be referred to a qualified practitioner if present. However,
an elevated BUN found in isolation of the pattern below is more indicative of renal insufficiency or other causes.

Renal insufficiency

An increased BUN level can be a sign of renal insufficiency, an often over-looked condition. Suspect renal insufficiency if there
is an increased BUN level with a normal or increased serum Creatinine, a normal to increased Uric Acid, and an increased
serum phosphorous. LDH and AST will usually be normal.

Dehydration

If BUN is increased suspect dehydration. Suspect a short-term (acute) dehydration if there is an increased HGB and/or HCT
along with an increased RBC count. A relative increase in Sodium and Potassium can be noted as well. Suspect a long-term
(chronic) dehydration if any of the above findings are accompanied by an increased Albumin, increased BUN and/or serum
Protein.

Hypochlorhydria

An increased BUN level is associated with hypochlorhydria, a decreased production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
Hypochlorhydria is possible with an increased globulin level and a normal or decreased Total Protein/Albumin.
Hypochlorhydria is probable if globulin levels are increased along with an increased BUN, a decreased or normal Total
Protein/Albumin and/or decreased serum Phosphorous. Other values that may be reflective of a developing or chronic
hypochlorhydria include increased or decreased gastrin, an increased MCV and MCH, a decreased (or normal) calcium, a
decreased iron, a decreased chloride, and a decreased alkaline phosphatase.

Diet- excessive protein intake or catabolism

Since the BUN level is dependent on dietary protein, an increased dietary protein or an increased catabolism of protein will
lead to an increased BUN level.
Adrenal stress

BUN levels will be increased in states of protein catabolism, which is increased in adrenal hyperfunction. Excess cortisol levels
will cause mobilization and an increased level of amino acids in the blood and liver by promoting protein catabolism. This will
increase the levels of BUN.

Dysbiosis

An increased BUN level in the absence of other causes may be due to dysbiosis.

Calcium,"Serum calcium levels, which are tightly regulated within a narrow range, are principally regulated by parathyroid hormone
(PTH) and vitamin D. A low calcium level indicates that calcium regulation is out of balance and not necessarily that the body
is deficient of calcium and needs supplementation. Check vitamin D levels, rule out hypochlorhydria, the need for magnesium,
phosphorous, vitamin A, B and C, unsaturated fatty acids, and iodine as some of the reasons for a calcium “need” before
supplementing with calcium. Elevated calcium is associated with parathyroid hyperfunction. If significantly elevated (>10.6
mg/dl or 2.65 mmol/L) check serum PTH levels and refer to an endocrinologist.","The majority of the calcium in the body (98-99%) is stored in the bone and teeth, which act as a major functional store. The
body will use this reservoir to maintain serum calcium at an optimal level. Serum Calcium exists in three different forms in the
plasma:

1. 40% of the calcium in the plasma is combined with plasma proteins such as albumin and is non-diffusible through the

cell membrane. It is therefore important to know the serum albumin level to interpret calcium levels.
2. 10% of the calcium in the plasma is combined to other substances, such as phosphate and citrate, and is freely diffusible
through the cell membrane

3. The remaining 50% of the plasma calcium is in the ionized form and is freely diffusible through the cellular membrane.
Approximately half of the plasma calcium is in an ionic form. This ionic calcium is the only form of calcium that can be used by
the body for its many physiological and metabolic functions: muscle contraction, blood clotting, cardiac function, and
transmission of nerve impulses to name a few.
PTH, produced from the parathyroid glands, is the most important hormone in calcium regulation. It promotes bone resorption
to increase serum calcium by activating osteoclasts, it increases the reabsorption of calcium from the urine, promotes the
activation of the active form of vitamin D (Cholecalciferol,) and enhances the absorption of calcium from the intestine.

Calcium absorption is dependent on an optimal acidity of the stomach. It is also affected by the amount of phosphate and
magnesium present. Actual absorption occurs in the upper part of the small intestine. Calcium affects the amount of protein
absorption and helps move fats through the intestinal wall.

lonized calcium is required for the biochemistry of inflammation and tissue repair, particularly the leukocytes for
phagocytosis. It is a vital component of the interstitial matrix facilitating cell to cell adhesion and communication, and
provides cell membrane stability. Calcium is also important in vascular integrity and clotting, and bone metabolism.

There is a predominant belief that calcium deficiency is very common and that most patients would benefit from daily
supplementation. Clinical experience suggests that a calcium need has less to do with calcium deficiency and more to do with
an inability to absorb and utilize dietary calcium.

When subjective indicators or lab testing identify a potential calcium need, the lack of synergistic co-factors that aid in
calcium metabolism is often the main problem.",8.6,10.4,2.15,2.6,8.9,9.5,2.22,2.38,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Before considering the clinical implications listed below, please check the serum albumin level to make sure that a decrease
in serum albumin is not the cause for a relative serum calcium decrease, as much of the serum calcium is bound to

albumin and this is the most common cause of a decreased calcium level.

For every decrease in albumin by 1 g/dL, calcium should be corrected upward by 0.8 mg/dL.

Parathyroid Hypofunction

Parathyroid hypofunction will lead to decreased PTH levels which can cause decreased serum calcium levels. If calcium is
decreased along with a high phosphorous level, parathyroid hypofunction is possible. Alkaline phosphatase levels may also be
normal or decreased. Follow up with a serum parathyroid hormone test. If parathyroid hormone levels are also decreased
presume clinical hypoparathyroidism exists.

Hypochlorhydria

A decreased serum calcium is often associated with a decreased production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach
(hypochlorhydria). Consider hypochlorhydria with a decreased serum calcium, an increased globulin level, and a normal or
decreased total protein along with an increased BUN, a decreased albumin, and a decreased serum phosphorous. The more
elements outside the optimal range, the greater the likelihood of hypochlorhydria. Other values that may be reflective of a
developing or chronic hypochlorhydria include increased or decreased gastrin, an increased MCV and MCH, a decreased iron, a
decreased CO2, decreased chloride level, and a decreased alkaline phosphatase.

Calcium Deficiency

Suspect calcium deficiency with low serum calcium along with a high phosphorous level and a decreased vitamin D level.
Consider that this may not just be a case of needing supplementation because there are a number of other factors at play here
that may be the cause of the calcium deficiency in the first place: hypochlorhydria, lack of vitamin D, and systemic pH issues to
name a few.","Parathyroid Hyperfunction

Parathyroid hyperfunction will cause an increase in PTH levels, which can lead to significantly increased serum calcium above
the normal reference range. If the serum calcium is significantly increased above the normal reference range with a decreased
phosphorous parathyroid hyperfunction is possible. Alkaline phosphatase levels may also be increased, along with a normal or
decreased serum or RBC magnesium. Follow-up with a serum parathyroid hormone test. If parathyroid hormone levels are also
increased, presume clinical hyperparathyroidism exists.

Thyroid dysfunction (primary or secondary)

Serum calcium may be increased in either primary thyroid hypofunction or secondary thyroid hypofunction due to anterior
pituitary hypofunction. With primary hypothyroidism the calcium levels may be increased along with an increased TSH. With
secondary thyroid hypofunction due to anterior pituitary hypofunction, the calcium levels may be increased along with a
decreased TSH.

Tissue/Cell Damage

Increased serum levels of calcium is associated with tissue or cell damage due to a disruption in the cellular membrane.
Calcium is a vital component of the interstitial matrix where it facilitates cell to cell adhesion and communication. Calcium will
be released into the serum if this matrix is disrupted. Space-occupying lesions should be considered and ruled out with
appropriate examination and testing.","• Ovarian hypofunction

Calcium : Albumin,"The Calcium:Albumin ratio is derived by comparing serum calcium levels to serum albumin levels. Because a significant portion
of calcium in the blood is bound to albumin, total serum calcium can be misleading in the presence of abnormal albumin
concentrations. lonized calcium—the physiologically active form—may remain within normal limits even when total serum
calcium is high or low, depending on the albumin level. Understanding the Calcium:Albumin ratio aids in distinguishing
between true hypo- or hypercalcemia and changes in albumin-bound calcium due to protein fluctuations.","Albumin serves as the primary carrier for calcium in the bloodstream, with roughly 40-45% of total serum calcium bound to
proteins (mostly albumin), another portion complexed to anions (like phosphate and citrate), and the remainder existing as
free, ionized calcium. Changes in albumin levels can significantly affect measured total calcium. For instance, in
hypoalbuminemia, total serum calcium may appear low despite normal ionized calcium, while hyperalbuminemia (or conditions
like multiple myeloma that elevate plasma proteins) can cause artificially high total calcium readings.

Acid-base balance also influences calcium binding to albumin. Acidosis decreases albumin’s affinity for calcium, leading to
increased ionized calcium (and potentially a higher Calcium:Albumin ratio), whereas alkalosis can reduce ionized calcium by
enhancing protein binding (often lowering the ratio). When evaluating patients with suspected calcium metabolism disorders,
measuring the Calcium:Albumin ratio provides additional clarity beyond a standalone total calcium or albumin test. It helps
clinicians differentiate genuine hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia from albumin-driven changes in total calcium.

Because vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) heavily regulate calcium homeostasis, abnormalities in the
Calcium:Albumin ratio should prompt further evaluation of vitamin D status, PTH levels, and renal function. Patients with
chronic protein-losing conditions (e.g., nephrotic syndrome) or malnutrition can have persistently low albumin, artificially
skewing calcium measurements. Conversely, certain malignancies or primary hyperparathyroidism can elevate total calcium to
the point where the ratio increases significantly, even if albumin is near normal.",0,2.6,0,0.06,0,2.18,0,0.05,ratio,ratio,"Calcium or Vitamin D Insufficiency

Insufficient dietary intake or malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can decrease the amount of ionized calcium relative to
albumin.

Hypoalbuminemia

Chronic malnutrition, liver disease, or protein-losing states (e.g., nephrotic syndrome) can lead to low albumin, but total
calcium may appear low despite normal ionized calcium, resulting in a lower ratio.

Alkalosis

Alkalotic states increase calcium binding to albumin, lowering ionized calcium and potentially reducing the Calcium:Albumin
ratio.","Protein Deficiency or Loss

If albumin drops more significantly than calcium, the ratio may rise, as total calcium remains relatively higher than albumin
(e.g., malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome).

Hypercalcemia

Conditions like primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or excess vitamin D can raise total serum calcium enough to increase
the ratio despite normal albumin levels.

Acidosis

In acidic conditions, albumin binds less calcium, increasing ionized calcium and potentially elevating the Calcium:Albumin ratio.",,,,,,,
Calcium : Phosphorus,"The Calcium:Phosphorus ratio is derived by measuring total serum calcium and serum phosphorus levels, typically expressed
as a ratio (e.g., 9.6 mg/dL calcium : 3.5 mg/dL phosphorus, approximating 2.75:1). This balance is largely maintained by the
parathyroid glands, which modulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis through parathyroid hormone (PTH), as well as by
vitamin D and renal excretion. Dietary factors also play a significant role, as foods high in phosphorus (relative to calcium) can
shift the ratio, promoting metabolic acidity and potentially depleting calcium stores.","low Calcium:Phosphorus ratio suggests either elevated phosphate or reduced calcium levels. Common causes include diets
high in phosphorus (often from processed or refined foods) and low in calcium, leading to increased bone mineral turnover
and inflammation. Additionally, endocrine disorders such as hypoparathyroidism or renal insufficiency can disrupt the ratio by
reducing serum calcium or causing phosphate retention. Chronic imbalance of this ratio can negatively affect bone health and
overall metabolic equilibrium.

Conversely, a high Calcium:Phosphorus ratio can occur when calcium levels are disproportionately high relative to phosphorus.
This is often seen in hyperparathyroidism, where excessive PTH drives calcium reabsorption from bone and reduces renal
phosphate reabsorption, leading to hypercalcemia and relatively lower phosphate. Malignancies with osteolytic metastases or
paraneoplastic secretion of PTH-related peptide may also elevate serum calcium and shift the ratio upward. Excessive calcium
supplementation is another factor, especially if dietary phosphate intake is low. Monitoring the Calcium:Phosphorus ratio, in
conjunction with PTH, vitamin D, and renal function tests, can help clinicians pinpoint the underlying cause of these
imbalances.",1.9,4.2,1.47,3.25,2.3,3.2,1.78,2.48,ratio,ratio,"A low calcium/phosphorus ratio favors the binding of calcium to phosphorus to form calcium phosphate. Phosphorus will
decrease the levels of ionized calcium.

Indicative of Decreased Calcium and Increased Phosphorus

A decreased Calcium:Phosphorus ratio below 2.3 indicates that there is either decreased serum calcium or increased serum
phosphorus, or both. Therefore, we need to look at the clinical implications of decreased calcium and increased phosphorus.
Parathyroid Hypofunction

Parathyroid hypofunction will lead to decreased PTH levels that can cause decreased serum calcium levels. If calcium is
decreased along with a high phosphorus level, parathyroid hypofunction is possible. Alkaline phosphatase levels may also be
normal or decreased. Follow up with a serum parathyroid hormone test. If parathyroid hormone levels are also decreased,
presume clinical hypoparathyroidism exists.

Hypochlorhydria

A decreased serum calcium is often associated with a decreased production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach
(hypochlorhydria). Consider hypochlorhydria with a decreased serum calcium, an increased or decreased globulin level, and a
normal or decreased total protein along with an increased BUN, a decreased albumin, and a decreased serum phosphorus. The
more elements outside the optimal range, the greater the likelihood of hypochlorhydria. Other values that may be reflective of
a developing or chronic hypochlorhydria include increased or decreased gastrin, an increased MCV and MCH, a decreased iron,
a decreased CO2, a decreased chloride level, an increased anion gap, and a decreased alkaline phosphatase.

Calcium Deficiency

Suspect calcium deficiency with low serum calcium along with a high phosphorus level and a decreased vitamin D level.
Consider that this may not just be a case of needing supplementation because there are a number of other factors at play here
that may be the cause of the calcium deficiency in the first place: hypochlorhydria, lack of vitamin D, and systemic pH issues to
name a few.
Bone Growth (Children) And Bone Repair (Fractures)

An increased phosphorus is a normal finding in times of increased bone growth and bone repair. Serum phosphorus will often
be increased in children up to 18 years of age (bone growth). Similar increases may be seen during bone repair (fractures).
Diet- excessive phosphate consumption

Serum phosphorus levels may be increased in people who drink a lot of soda pop. Phosphoric acid is a common additive in
sodas and can lead to excessive levels of ingested phosphorus that can cause significant problems with the
calcium/phosphorus ratio, leading to decreased serum calcium.

Renal Insufficiency

An increased phosphorus level can be a sign of renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency is an often overlooked condition.
Suspect renal insufficiency if there is an increased serum phosphorus, an increased BUN level with a normal or increased
serum creatinine, and a normal to increased uric acid. LDH and AST will usually be normal.","A high calcium/phosphorus ratio favors deposition of calcium into the soft tissue. This deposition will decrease the availability
of ionized calcium and reduce the serum calcium reading.

Indicative of Excess Calcium and Decreased Phosphorus

An increased Calcium:Phosphorus ratio above 3.2 indicates that there is either excess serum calcium or decreased serum
phosphorus, or both. Therefore, we need to look at the clinical implications of elevated calcium and decreased phosphorus.
Parathyroid Hyperfunction

Parathyroid hyperfunction will cause an increase in PTH levels, which can lead to significantly increased serum calcium above
the normal reference range. If the serum calcium is significantly increased above the standard reference range with a
decreased phosphorus parathyroid hyperfunction is possible. Alkaline phosphatase levels may also be increased, along with a
normal or decreased serum or RBC magnesium. Follow-up with a serum parathyroid hormone test. If parathyroid hormone
levels are also increased, presume clinical hyperparathyroidism exists.

Thyroid dysfunction (primary or secondary)

Serum calcium may be increased in either primary thyroid hypofunction or secondary thyroid hypofunction due to anterior
pituitary hypofunction. With primary hypothyroidism, the calcium levels may be increased along with an increased TSH. With
secondary thyroid hypofunction due to anterior pituitary hypofunction, the calcium levels may be increased along with a
decreased TSH.

Tissue/Cell Damage

Increased serum levels of calcium is associated with tissue or cell damage due to a disruption in the cellular membrane.
Calcium is a vital component of the interstitial matrix where it facilitates cell to cell adhesion and communication. Calcium will
be released into the serum if this matrix is disrupted. Space-occupying lesions should be considered and ruled out with
appropriate examination and testing.

Hyperinsulinism

Phosphate crosses the cell membrane with glucose. Hyperinsulinism, therefore, will cause an increased uptake of glucose by
the cells and will also increase phosphorus uptake, possibly contributing to a decreased serum phosphorus level.

Diet- high in refined carbohydrates

Phosphate crosses the cell membrane with glucose. Plasma levels may be decreased after a meal high in refined
carbohydrates. A diet high in refined carbohydrates and sugars will deplete phosphorus stores and other important co-factors
for carbohydrate metabolism.",,,,,,,
Ceruloplasmin,"Ceruloplasmin is a copper-containing protein that is produced in the liver and released into the blood. Ceruloplasmin is
considered the most sensitive indicator of clinical copper deficiency. Ceruloplasmin may become elevated in with elevated
copper levels in the body, inflammation, and infection. Low levels of ceruloplasmin are associated with copper deficiency.","Ceruloplasmin is a copper-containing protein produced primarily by the liver, though some is produced in lymphocytes and
macrophages.

It binds and carries up to 95% of circulating copper and is considered the most sensitive marker of copper deficiency.
Ceruloplasmin also has important antioxidant properties as an oxidase enzyme in iron, copper, and glutathione metabolism. It
possess nitric oxidase (NO) catalytic activity and helps regulate NO homeostasis.

Measuring serum ceruloplasmin assists in diagnosing Wilson’s disease, Menkes disease, abnormal copper metabolism, and
copper deficiency.

Menkes disease is a genetic disorder characterized by decreased ceruloplasmin and inability to remove copper, allowing
abnormal levels of intracellular copper to build up. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in which
serum levels of ceruloplasmin may be low or normal despite increasing levels in the brain, liver, and other organs.
Ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant and may be elevated in infection, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and other
inflammatory conditions. Elevated ceruloplasmin strongly correlates with levels of hs-CRP and is considered an independent
risk factor for cardiac events. In general, elevated ceruloplasmin tends to be more common in older females with
cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia and diabetes, as well as reduced renal sufficiency.

As availability of copper decreases, so does ceruloplasmin. Deficiency of copper is characterized by reduction in energy
production; alteration in glucose and cholesterol metabolism; accumulation of tissue iron; increased oxidative stress; altered
immune cell structure and function; impairment of the electrical activity and contractility of the heart; disruption in
neuropeptide synthesis and function; and aberrations in neurobehavioral stability.

Ceruloplasmin plays a vital role in iron metabolism and oxidizes ferrous iron into its less toxic ferric form. It assists mobilization
of iron from tissue stores to serum, where the iron can then be safely transported by transferrin. Low ceruloplasmin will lead
to a reduction of circulating iron and hemoglobin and contribute to anemia.

Lack of ceruloplasmin, as occurs in the genetic disorder aceruloplasminemia, can lead to a toxic buildup of iron in sensitive
tissues such as the pancreas, leading to diabetes in these genetically prone individuals.

Ceruloplasmin has an extensive range of clinical utility and provides another tool in the optimal diagnosis toolbox. For more
comprehensive assessment, serum and RBC copper should be evaluated along with ceruloplasmin. Further evaluation of
inflammation including hs-CRP, ferritin, homocysteine, fibrinogen, IL-6, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio would be prudent
as well.",19,39,1.42,2.91,18,21,1.34,1.57,mg/dL,umol/L,"Copper Deficiency

Low ceruloplasmin along with low serum and RBC copper and/or urine copper is a finding for copper deficiency. As the

Anemia

Low ceruloplasmin may be associated with anemia due to its role in copper and iron metabolism.

Autism

Low serum ceruloplasmin levels have been observed in autism, possibly increasing exposure to unbound copper.

Hepatic insufficiency

Reduced liver function or fibrosis may lead to reduced production of ceruloplasmin.

Menkes disease

Ceruloplasmin is decreased in Menkes disease (a disorder marked by decreased absorption, transport, and cellular elimination

Wilson’s disease

Ceruloplasmin levels may be low or normal in the blood despite increasing levels in tissues of the brain, liver, and other organs.
In Wilson’s disease, RBC copper may be normal or low, serum copper will be elevated and urine copper will be very high.

Zinc supplementation

Excess intake of zinc can lead to copper deficiency and decreased levels of ceruloplasmin. Anything that interferes with
copper metabolism may affect ceruloplasmin and copper levels.","Increased Disease Risk

Elevated ceruloplasmin may be associated with cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and renal insufficiency.
Copper Toxicity

Increased levels of ceruloplasmin are found in cases of copper toxicity. Expect to also see high levels of RBC and serum
copper, and Urine Copper.

Acute-phase reactant

Ceruloplasmin is considered an acute phase reactant and may be elevated in cases of severe infection, inflammation, tissue
damage, coronary syndrome, and cancer. There is a strong direct correlation between ceruloplasmin and elevated hs-CRP.
Inflammation

Increased levels of ceruloplasmin may indicate systemic inflammation. Further evaluation of inflammation including hs-CRP,
ferritin, homocysteine, fibrinogen, IL-6, and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio would be prudent as well.

Primary biliary cirrhosis

Ceruloplasmin increases in primary biliary cirrhosis, possibly to assist in metabolizing accumulated hepatic copper.

Chloride,"Chloride plays an important role in human physiology. The amount of serum chloride is carefully regulated by the kidneys.
Chloride is involved in regulating the acid-base balance in the body. Increased levels are associated with metabolic acidosis
and decreased levels are associated with metabolic alkalosis. Chloride is an important molecule in the production of
hydrochloric acid in the stomach so decreased levels are associated with hypochlorhydria.","Chloride is the principle extracellular anion, existing in extracellular spaces in the form of sodium chloride or hydrochloric acid.
Chloride is under the same influence as sodium and is affected by many of the same conditions that affect serum

sodium levels, due to their reciprocal relationship. Aldosterone, which will cause an increased reabsorption of sodium from the
kidney, will also cause an increase in chloride reabsorption, thus raising the levels of serum sodium and chloride. Chloride levels
will most often change in the same direction as sodium, i.e. if the serum sodium is decreased, we can expect to see a
decreased chloride level.

On the other hand chloride has an inverse relationship with CO2 levels. Metabolic acidosis will have an increased chloride level
and a decreased CO2 level. Metabolic alkalosis will have a decreased chloride and an increased CO2.

Chloride helps maintain cellular integrity by playing a role in influencing osmotic pressure and acid-base balance.

Chloride ions are excreted along with other cations, such as sodium and potassium during diuresis and are lost from the
stomach during bouts of vomiting and/or diarrhea.",98,110,98,110,100,106,100,106,mEq/L,mmol/L,"Hypochlorhydria

A decreased chloride level is associated with hypochlorhydria. Chloride is one of the main elements necessary for the
production of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells of the stomach. Consider hypochlorhydria with a decreased chloride level,
an increased or decreased globulin level, and a normal or decreased total protein along with an increased BUN, a decreased
albumin, and a decreased serum phosphorous. The more elements outside the optimal range, the greater the likelihood of
hypochlorhydria. Other values that may be reflective of a developing or chronic hypochlorhydria include increased or
decreased gastrin, an increased MCV, and MCH, a decreased iron, a decreased CO2, decreased serum calcium, and an

Adrenal Insufficiency

Adrenal insufficiency is associated with a decreased serum chloride level. Consider adrenal insufficiency if the chloride levels

Cholesterol - Total,"Cholesterol is a steroid found in every cell of the body and in the plasma. It is an essential component in the structure of the
cell membrane where it controls membrane fluidity. It provides the structural backbone for every steroid hormone in the body,
which includes adrenal and sex hormones and vitamin D. The myelin sheaths of nerve fibers are derived from cholesterol and
the bile salts that emulsify fats are composed of cholesterol. Cholesterol is made in the body by the liver and other organs and
from dietary sources. The liver, the intestines, and the skin produce between 60-80% of the body’s cholesterol. The remainder
comes from the diet. Increased cholesterol is just one of many independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It is also
associated with metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, biliary stasis, and fatty liver. Decreased cholesterol levels are a strong
indicator of gallbladder dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammatory process, low-fat diets, and an increased heavy metal
burden.","The link between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease is widely known, yet is not as important. What are not so well
recognized are cholesterol’s antioxidant activities in the body.

Cholesterol, in its unoxidized form, has free radical scavenging properties, and as such functions as a natural cell membrane
protector. It protects cells from cancer and other free-radical induced diseases. Thus low levels of cholesterol present an
increased risk for oxidative stress. In its oxidized state, cholesterol can act as a pro-oxidant and a free radical producer.
Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl-CoA in a series of enzymatic steps that require vitamins B6, B12, and folate as
coenzymes. Cholesterol synthesis shares its rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase with the enzymatic synthesis of
Coenzyme Q10.

HMG-CoA reductase is the target of many of the cholesterol lowering drugs, whose activity can play havoc on the body's
synthesis of Co QIO.

Total cholesterol comprises all of the cholesterol found in the body, i.e. LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides/5,
which is an estimation of VLDL cholesterol. Levels are influenced by metabolic rate, and increased levels of cholesterol are
often associated with thyroid or adrenal hypofunction. Conversely, decreased levels are associated with endocrine
hyperfunction.

Although total serum cholesterol can give a good general assessment of cardiovascular risk, other tests and markers should be
taken into consideration to give a more accurate and complete picture of possible atherosclerotic coronary artery disease risk.
These include apolipoprotein A and B, HDL, LDL, VLDL, serum homocysteine, and triglycerides.

Note: Cholesterol values should only be taken after at least a 12-hour fast.",125,199,3.23,5.15,160,199,4.14,5.15,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Oxidative Stress and Free Radical Activity

Suspect excess free radical activity and oxidative stress if the total cholesterol is suddenly below its historical level and is seen
with a decreased lymphocyte count, a decreased albumin and platelet count, an increased total globulin and uric acid level,
free radical pathology should be investigated. Oxidative stress can cause an increased destruction of red blood cells; in these
situations you will see an elevated bilirubin level.

Heavy metal burden

patients with historically low total cholesterol levels may be more prone to heavy metal and chemical toxins due to poor cell
membrane integrity. This is irrespective of level of exposure, but related more to susceptibility of the individual patient.
Liver/gallbladder dysfunction

Gallbladder dysfunction limits the emulsification and digestion of fats, potentially leading to a decreased level of cholesterol.
Liver dysfunction, such as late stage fatty liver, can also prevent the synthesis of endogenous cholesterol, triglycerides, and
other lipids and lipoproteins. J. Mercola, DO, in his newsletter “Healthy News you can use”, http://www.mercola.com, reported
that, in his opinion, most low cholesterol levels are due to a dysfunctional gallbladder.

Diet- Fat Deficient

Low cholesterol along with a low triglyceride level is a sign of a fat deficient diet. This is a pattern that is commonly seen in
vegetarians. Check red blood cell levels of essential fatty acids to determine essential fatty acid need. This may also be due a
gallbladder dysfunction that causes a decrease in the emulsification and digestion of dietary fats and not necessarily a
decrease in fats in the diet.

Thyroid hyperfunction

Hyperthyroidism is probable if there are low triglycerides with a low TSH and a high total T-3, free T3, and total T4. The low
cholesterol levels are probably due to the excessive utilization of fatty acids by a metabolism that is excessively fast.
Inflammatory processes

If the cholesterol level is low or normal, triglycerides are decreased and HDL is increased, then some kind of inflammatory
process in the body is possible. Consider further testing to rule out tissue inflammation or destruction (C-reactive protein,
ANA, rheumatoid factor etc.). If tissue destruction is present, LDH, Alpha 1, or Alpha 2 globulin (seen with serum protein
electrophoresis) will frequently be increased.

Adrenal stress

Low cholesterol levels may be due to the excessive metabolism often seen in patients with adrenal stress. They are burning up
their lipids with their high levels of hormones. If you suspect this, order a salivary adrenal test to rule this out.","Increased cardiovascular disease risk

Increased cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis,
coronary artery disease and stroke. Although this may be true, it is important to look at many of the other risks for this disease
before jumping to conclusion that elevated cholesterol levels are the culprit. Other risks for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular
disease and stroke include: smoking, elevated homocysteine levels, elevated fasting glucose, elevated fasting insulin, elevated
Hs-CRP, elevated fibrinogen, B6, B12 and folate deficiency, ingestion of chlorine, blood sugar dysregulation, and hypertension.
Consider an increased risk of cardiovascular disease with an increased triglyceride level in relation to an increased total
cholesterol with an increased uric acid level, a decreased HDL and an increased LDL. Platelet levels may also be increased.
Homocysteine, Hs-CRP, and Fibrinogen levels are frequently increased.

Primary hypothyroidism

Primary hypothyroidism is possible if the total cholesterol is increased along with an increased triglyceride and TSH.

Adrenal insufficiency

Consider adrenal insufficiency if the total cholesterol is elevated with an increased triglyceride level and a decreased serum
potassium. Confirm with salivary adrenal studies or other functional adrenal tests.

Secondary Hypothyroidism (Anterior pituitary dysfunction)

Increased cholesterol levels are associated with thyroid hypofunction that is secondary to an anterior pituitary dysfunction. If
cholesterol levels are increased with a decreased TSH and an elevated serum triglyceride, then consider that anterior pituitary
hypofunction is probable.

Gallbladder dysfunction - Biliary stasis

Thickened bile is the hallmark of biliary stasis. It may occur if the total cholesterol is increased. GGTP levels will frequently be
increased but not necessarily. Bilirubin levels may also be elevated. There may also be an increased alkaline phosphatase. The
ALT and AST may be normal or increased. However, many cases of biliary stasis will show normal lab values.

Metabolic Syndrome

If triglycerides are increased above the total cholesterol level with increased LDL cholesterol, a decreased HDL, and an
increased fasting blood glucose, and fasting insulin, then metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia is probable.

Fatty liver (early development) and Liver congestion

If total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels are increased and HDL levels are decreased, then fatty liver is possible. Liver
congestion, due to the early development of fatty liver, should be considered if total cholesterol and triglycerides are both
increased, and the ALT is decreased.

Early stage of insulin resistance

Elevated cholesterol and other lipids often accompany the elevated glucose levels that are seen in insulin resistance.

Poor metabolism and utilization of fats

This is often the case in patients that are eating an optimal diet and have elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

Early stage Diabetes

Elevated blood lipids are seen in patients with diabetes. The triglycerides are often higher than the total cholesterol level. Lipid

CK-MB is an enzyme that helps generate energy. It is found mainly in cardiac tissue. Blood levels of CK-MB increase following
myocardial infarction but can also increase due to non-cardiac issues. The measurement of CK-MB for diagnosing an Ml has
primarily been replaced by troponin, a more cardiac-specific protein. A low CK-MB blood level suggests the absence of cardiac
muscle damage. A high CK-MB may be associated with myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or intervention, increased

muscle diseases such as inflammatory myopathy and muscular dystrophy.

While CK-MB was once a primary marker for diagnosing heart attacks, it has largely been replaced by troponins, which are
more specific to heart muscle damage. However, CK-MB is still useful in assessing cardiac injury after interventions like

dioxide gas. Conditions such as respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, which are conditions of primary
CO2 increase or decrease are best evaluated and followed-up with other readings and studies (i.e. serum chloride, anion gap,
blood gases).",19,30,19,30,25,30,25,30,mEq/L,mmol/L,"Metabolic Acidosis

Serum CO2, or bicarbonate will be decreased (<25), in metabolic acidosis. Consider metabolic acidosis if the CO2 is decreased
(<25), along with an increased chloride (>106) and/or an increased anion gap (>12).

Respiratory alkalosis

The CO2 levels (<25) are often decreased in respiratory alkalosis, which is due to conditions that cause excess loss of CO2
from the lungs. The classic presentation of this phenomenon is hyperventilation syndrome caused by hysteria, anxiety, stress,
etc. Other causes include low blood pressure, shock, direct stimulation of the respiratory centers by drugs or trauma, and high
altitude. Bicarbonate is lost due to the formation of CO2 in the lungs.","Metabolic Alkalosis

CO2, or bicarbonate, will be increased in metabolic alkalosis. Consider metabolic alkalosis if the CO2 is increased (>30), along
with a decreased chloride (<100), a decreased calcium (<9.2 or 2.30 mmol/L), and a decreased serum potassium (<4.0).
Hypochlorhydria

With hypochlorhydria (low levels of stomach acid) the body will attempt to increase acidity by increasing the production of
the H+ ion, which leads to a rise in CO2 levels (bicarbonate) in the serum.

Respiratory acidosis

Serum CO2 levels are often increased in respiratory acidosis (>30), which is due to conditions that cause pulmonary retention
of CO2. Some of the conditions include asthma, high blood pressure, damage to the respiratory centers, chest trauma, chronic
respiratory diseases (emphysema and pneumonia) and obstruction of the respiratory passage.","• Dehydration

Collagen Cross-Linked NTx,"The Collagen Cross-Linked N-Telopeptide test tells us about bone loss. Bone resorption by osteoclasts results in the
production of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type | collagen (NTx). NTx is specific to bone and is found in urine as a stable
end-product of bone degradation. Levels of NTx correlate with the rate of bone resorption. Bone resorption rates exceeding
bone formation results in a net loss of bone and ultimately osteopenia or osteoporosis.
","Approximately 90% of the organic matrix of mammalian bone consists of type | collagen that is cross-linked at the N-terminal
and C-terminal ends. This highly cross-linked structure provides for the basic fabric and tensile strength of bone tissue. The
collagen infrastructure of bone undergoes a continuous process of remodeling that involves osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Osteoporosis occurs when there is an imbalance between bone formation
and bone resorption leading to net bone loss. Certain aspects of this bone composition and structure that contribute to
increased bone fragility may not be captured by bone mineral density measurements.

Osteoporotic fractures are a major source of morbidity and mortality in older women. The NTx test is intended for use in
predicting skeletal response to hormonal antiresorptive therapy in postmenopausal women. The NTx test can also be used to
monitor the efficacy of antiresorptive therapy in postmenopausal women, women with osteoporosis, and individuals with
Paget disease. The NTx test can also be used in monitoring the effect of estrogen-suppressing therapies on the rate of bone
resorption. A recent study supported the use of NTx to identify the probability of a decrease in bone mineral density after one
year in postmenopausal women receiving a calcium supplement relative to those treated with hormonal antiresorptive therapy.
Several studies have shown that certain biochemical markers of bone turnover, measured in serum or urine, can be used as
independent predictors of fractures, especially spine and hip. Bone mineral density (BMD) is often used to monitor the efficacy
of osteoporosis treatment and to follow patient compliance. Unfortunately, changes in BMD in response to treatment are slow,
and it takes at least one year of treatment before a significant change in BMD can be observed in many cases. As a result, the
absence of BMD increase does not necessarily indicate a lack of therapeutic response. The use of NTx can be helpful for
assessing early changes in BMD (baseline vs post-treatment) revealing a biological effect of the medication and proving
patient compliance and persistence.

A decline of 30% or more of NTx over a six-month period suggests effective therapy.",0,64,0,64,0,38,0,38,nmol BCE/mmol creat,nmol BCE/mmol creat,Decreased levels are generally not clinically significant.,"Increased Osteoclastic Activity

RBC copper is a more accurate reflection of total body copper than serum copper. Measuring RBC copper can be useful in
assessing inflammatory processes, anemia, and immune function.","Copper is an essential trace mineral involved in multiple functions including energy production, iron transport,
neurotransmitter synthesis, antioxidant activity, regulation of gene expression, red and white blood cell maturation, bone
strength, brain development, and the metabolism of glucose and cholesterol. It plays a role in the formation of myelin, melanin,
and connective tissue as well. The brain and liver contain the highest concentrations of copper and a deficiency will adversely
affect these organs as well as any tissues metabolically depending on copper. Excess copper in any tissues or organs can

Copper - Serum,"Serum copper is an essential trace element measured in the blood that plays diverse roles in human physiology. It is a cofactor
for several enzymes involved in energy production, iron metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and antioxidant defense.
Copper is also necessary for the formation of myelin, melanin, and connective tissue, impacting brain development and bone
strength. The highest concentrations of copper are found in the liver and brain, underscoring its importance in these tissues.
Maintaining optimal copper levels is critical, as both deficiency and excess can have significant clinical consequences.","Low serum copper, or copper deficiency, can arise from insufficient dietary intake, malabsorption syndromes, or genetic
disorders such as Menkes disease. Clinically, a deficiency in copper can lead to anemia, neutropenia, neurological deficits (such
as ataxia or peripheral neuropathy), and connective tissue abnormalities due to impaired collagen cross-linking. In the context
of liver and brain function, reduced copper levels can compromise the activities of key enzymes, thereby affecting energy
production, myelin formation, and antioxidant defenses. This deficiency may be masked if only serum copper is measured, so
clinical evaluation should include a comprehensive nutritional assessment.

Conversely, high serum copper levels are often indicative of copper overload, which may result from conditions like Wilson’s
disease, where impaired copper excretion leads to accumulation in tissues, or from excessive exogenous intake (e.g.,
supplementation). Elevated copper levels can cause oxidative stress, leading to cellular damage particularly in the liver and
brain. Copper overload may disrupt iron metabolism and inflammatory pathways, potentially manifesting with neuropsychiatric
symptoms, hepatic dysfunction, and even hemolytic anemia. The interpretation of serum copper must consider related
biomarkers such as ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, and clinical findings to accurately assess copper status and its

Copper : Zinc Ratio,"The balance between copper and zinc is important as an excess of one can cause a deficiency of the other, disrupting many
important metabolic functions. A decreased copper : zinc ratio is associated with copper deficiency or excess zinc levels.
Elevated Copper : Zinc ratio is associated with increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and an increased risk of infection.","Calculating the ratio between copper and zinc (the CZr) provides information about inflammation, immune competence,
oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity.

One prospective study of 498 free-living Italian elders found that an increased CZr was associated with increased markers of
inflammation including decreased albumin and increased CRP, ESR, and IL-6; as well as increased risk of all-cause mortality.
The CZr value in the highest tertile was above 1.78 for males and 2.06 for females, while the lowest tertile CZr values were
below 1.41 for males and below 1.53 for females. The CZr increased with age and was higher in those with stable CVD and in
those who had died by the end of the 3.5-year follow-up period (Malavolta 2010).

A CZr above 2.0 is associated with an increased inflammatory response, especially in the elderly. The increase in CZr seen with
inflammation and infection appears to be partly due to the immune system reducing serum zinc to reduce its availability to
pathogens. The immune response may also be associated with an increase in serum copper as it is transferred to the site of
injury or infection. The increase in CZr with aging may also reflect a mobilization of resources from a state of growth and
proliferation to one of maintenance and repair (Malavolta 2015). In one study of 143 elderly subjects, elevated CZr was
associated with significantly elevated systemic oxidative stress and higher plasma lipid peroxides which increased as CZr
increased. The CZr was significantly higher in those with chronic degenerative diseases versus those who were healthier
(Mezzetti 1998).

A study of multidrug resistant tuberculosis found a significantly decreased zinc and significantly increased CZr in patients
versus controls free of disease. Initial pretreatment CZr in patients was 5.71 in males and 4.13 in females, versus controls with a
CZr of 1.29 in males and 1.21 in females. Researchers note that the CZr ratio reflects zinc status in these patients and that a CZr
above 2 indicates severe infection (Bahi 2017).

cross-sectional study of copper to zinc ratio in 191 healthy women of child-bearing age was carried out in China. The inclusion
criteria strictly defined healthy ranges for BMI, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, glucose, HbAIC, hemoglobin, uric acid,
blood pressure, and heart rate. The study yielded a reference interval for plasma CZr of 0.54-1.68, while the geometric mean
for plasma CZr was of 0.81-0.96. Plasma copper ranged from 74.30-170.68 g/dL (11.67-26.8 umol/L) and plasma zinc ranged
from 70.46-177.53 g/dL (10.78-2716 umol/L). Researchers note that the immune response to infection is most effective with
a balanced CZr closest to 1:1 (Zhang 2021).

The CZr may be useful in evaluating the presence and degree of malignancy in lung cancer. In one study of 184 subjects, those
with a malignant lesion had a significantly higher mean CZr at 2.24 compared to 1.63 with a benign lesion and 1.43 in controls.
The CZr was significantly higher at 2.65 in those with advanced stage 3 disease versus 1.9 in those at stages land 3.
Researchers suggest a cut-off of 1.72 to help identify malignant disease (Diez 1989).

The CZr may be useful in evaluating neurobehavioral function AS WELL. Autistic children had a higher CZr (and lower zinc to
copper ratio) as severity of autism increased. Those with autism had a mean CZr of 1.65 versus 1.38 in controls (Viktorinova
2016). The copper to zinc ratio may be useful in evaluating violent behavior as well. An elevated CZr was observed in
assaultive young males 3-20 years old compared to controls. The median CZr in violent subjects was significantly higher at 1.4
compared to 1.02 in controls (Walsh 1997).

Targeted supplementation can help restore a healthy CZr as demonstrated in a randomized study of hemodialysis (HD)
patients with a plasma zinc below 80 mg/dL (12.24 umol/L), with a mean value of 40 mg/dL (6.1 umol/L). The mean CZr was
2.4-2.5 in HD patients and 0.7 in healthy controls. The group of HD patients receiving 11 mg of elemental zinc for eight weeks
experienced an increase in plasma zinc and a decrease in CZr; a reduction in inflammatory markers and oxidative stress; and
significantly higher CD4 and CD19 lymphocyte counts as well as an increase in CD4/CD8 ratios. Zinc supplementation was also
associated with increases in beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E levels (Guo 2013).",0.8,2,0.8,2,0.7,1.5,0.7,1.5,ratio,ratio,"Copper Deficiency

A low CZr suggests an insufficiency of copper likely due to inadequate copper intake or excess zinc intake which decreases
copper absorption.

Zinc Toxicity

A low CZr may reflect excess zinc intake which reduces copper absorption.","Infection

The increased CZr seen in infection and associated inflammation may be due to an immune defense-related decrease in serum
zinc.

Inflammation

An increasing CZr is associated with increasing biomarkers of inflammation such as elevated CRP, ESR, and IL-6, and
decreasing albumin.

Oxidative Stress

Elevated oxidative stress is associated with an increased CZr reflective of increased copper and decreased zinc. The higher the
CZr, the higher the plasma lipid peroxides observed.

Stress

Prolonged elevation of glucocorticoids during stress can increase serum copper and decrease zinc leading to an elevated CZr.
Education Underperformance

An increasing CZr is associated with a significant decrease in GPA and educational achievement even when controlled for
parental background.

Degenerative Disease

The CZr and oxidative stress are significantly increased in those with age-related chronic degenerative disease. The increase
appears to be associated with both an increased copper level and a decreased zinc level.

including the control of blood sugar balance, the regulation of metabolism, reducing inflammation, and controlling blood
pressure.

Like other glucocorticosteroids, cortisol is synthesized from the common precursor cholesterol in the adrenal glands. For the
transport of cortisol in the blood, about 90% of cortisol is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and to albumin.
Only a small amount of cortisol circulates unbound in blood and is free to interact with its receptors.

The most important physiological effects of cortisol are the increase of blood glucose levels (enhancement of

Cortisol : DHEA-S,"Cortisol and DHEA are both hormones produced by the adrenal glands, and both can affect immunity, resilience to stress,
brain function, and behavior.

Evaluating the ratio between cortisol and DHEA-S (the most abundant form of DHEA) can provide information about the risk
of infection, cognitive dysfunction, and metabolic health.

A higher ratio of cortisol to DHEA-S is associated with stress, metabolic syndrome, immune dysfunction, and all-cause
mortality.","The hormones cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) participate in maintaining homeostasis in the face of various
threats and stressors. Both are produced in the adrenal glands from cholesterol. However, DHEA is also synthesized in the
brain, ovaries, and testes and can be converted to androstenedione, testosterone, and estradiol. DHEA-S is the sulfated form of
DHEA and the most abundant form in circulation. DHEA-S has the same physiological effects as DHEA. Both cortisol and
DHEA-S effect neurotransmitters, cognition, behavior, motivation, and emotional stability. An imbalance in their relative ratio
can negatively affect these factors. A higher cortisol to DHEA-S ratio has been associated with cognitive deterioration,
immune dysfunction, treatment-resistant depression, and even schizophrenia. DHEA-S can offset some of the neurotoxic
effects of cortisol on memory and cognitive performance if present in adequate amounts. DHEA-S is also able to moderate the
negative effects of cortisol on the immune system including suppression of T-cells, lymphocytes, and antibody production. An
increase in the cortisol:DHEA-S ratio is associated with higher rates of mortality and infection following injury (Kamin 2017).
Prolonged stress can lead to higher cortisol levels and a higher cortisol to DHEA-S ratio due to dysregulated HPA axis
feedback, as well as a shift in the use of cholesterol-based pregnenolone from DHEA to cortisol. An increased ratio has also
been associated with recent stressful events; workdays versus weekends; training stress in athletes; poorer military
performance; ADHD; and symptoms of negative affect and dissociation. Chronic stress and HPA activation can lead to adrenal
fatigue and downregulation of both DHEA-S and eventually cortisol. Interestingly, a low cortisol:DHEA-S ratio has been
associated with conduct disorders, aggression, and antisocial behavior in adolescents (Kamin 2017).

The cortisol:DHEA-S ratio can increase with age as adrenal production of DHEA decreases and cortisol remains stable, a
change associated with reduced immunity, mood disturbances, anxiety, confusion, and compromised cognitive performance
(Phillips 2010 vol. 163). The higher cortisol:DHEA-S ratio seen with aging may be mitigated with aerobic exercise and
conditioning, especially in those under greater stress (Heaney 2014).

Under normal circumstances, circulating DHEA-S is approximately 5 to 10 times higher than circulating cortisol (Ritsner 2005).
However, stress, aging, and illness can alter this ratio. A prospective cohort analysis of 4,255 Vietnam veterans evaluated in the
Vietnam Experience Study found that higher cortisol:DHEA-S ratio was significantly associated with all-cause mortality
including that from cancer and infectious disease, but not from CVD. The mean cortisol: DHEA-S ratio for the entire group was
0.09. Researchers conclude that a higher DHEA-S in particular was protective against all-cause mortality (Phillips 2010 vol.
163).

An increased ratio of cortisol to DHEA-S is observed in metabolic syndrome as well. Further evaluation of the 4,255 Vietnam
veterans revealed that high cortisol was associated with metabolic syndrome while higher levels of DHEA-S were protective.
An increasing cortisol:DHEA-S ratio was associated with incident metabolic syndrome as well as four associated components,
i.e., high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high triglycerides, and low HDL. The mean cortisol:DHEA-S ratio for those with
metabolic syndrome was 0.102 versus 0.088 in those without metabolic syndrome (Phillips 2010, vol. 162).

A decreasing DHEA-S and increasing cortisol: DHEA-S ratio may contribute to the progression of diabetes, atherosclerosis,
osteoporosis, cognitive decline, and dementia. Repletion of DHEA-S in the case of adrenal insufficiency may correct some of
the associated symptoms including cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and immune dysfunction (Chehab 2007).

A higher cortisol: DHEA-S ratio is associated with sarcopenia, possibly due to the muscle wasting and catabolic effects of
cortisol. It can also be associated with a decline in DHEA-S which is anabolic. One study of 108 diabetic subjects 65 years or
older found a cortisol: DHEA-S ratio of 0.2 or above to be a significant independent risk factor for the presence and severity of
sarcopenia. The elevated ratio was due to both higher cortisol and lower DHEA-S in those with sarcopenia. A cut-off of 0.14
and above should be investigated further for sarcopenia (Yanagita 2019).
Cortisol and DHEA-S influence immunity as well, with cortisol suppressing immunity and DHEA-S enhancing it. An imbalance
can contribute to immunosuppression and subsequent infection. In one study of hip fracture patients aged 65 or over, those
who developed an infection had a significantly higher cortisol:DHEA-S ratio (0.56) than age-matched controls (0.36) and
young patients with fractures (0.087). A significantly higher ratio was also seen in elderly patients who died of infection
(0.803) compared to those who did not (0.467). Researchers note that fracture patients had a robust increase in circulating
neutrophils but a decrease in neutrophil function and production of superoxide, making them more susceptible to infection
(Butcher 2005).

A significantly higher cortisol: DHEA.-S ratio and suppressed neutrophil superoxide production was also seen in 24 elderly
bereaved subjects compared to controls. Researchers note an increased incidence of infection in older bereaved subjects
(Khanfer 2011).",0,0.09,0,0.09,0,0.09,0,0.09,ratio,ratio,"Behavioral Abnormalities
A low cortisol:DHEA-S ratio has been associated with conduct disorders, aggression, and antisocial behavior.","Stress

An elevated cortisol: DHEA-S ratio may be reflective of increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. As stress becomes
chronic, DHEA-S will decline followed by a decrease in cortisol as adrenal fatigue sets in. A higher ratio is also associated with
weekdays versus weekends, and even the stress of athletic training.

Immune Dysfunction

Elevated cortisol to DHEA-S ratio is associated with immunosuppression and increased risk of mortality, including death due to
infection. Cortisol is inmunosuppressive while DHEA-S is immune supportive.

Metabolic Syndrome

A higher cortisol: DHEA-S ratio is associated with incidence of metabolic syndrome as well as four of its components, i.e., high
glucose, high triglycerides, high blood pressure, and low HDL.

Cognitive Dysfunction

An elevated cortisol: DHEA-S ratio has been associated with a decline in memory and cognitive performance, particularly when
due to elevated cortisol which can be neurotoxic. An elevated ratio has also been associated with ADHD, treatment-resistant
depression, and cognitive deterioration.

Aging

An elevated ratio can be seen as DHEA production tends to decline with age even with cortisol remaining stable, causing an
increase in the relative ratio. This altered ratio is associated with mood disturbances, anxiety, and confusion. The higher
cortisol:DHEA-S ratio and associated changes with aging can be buffered to some extent with aerobic activity.

Sarcopenia

Higher cortisol and a higher cortisol to DHEA-S ratio are associated with muscle wasting known as sarcopenia. This effect may
be due to elevated cortisol which is catabolic, as well as a decline in DHEA-S which is anabolic.",,,,,,,

C-Reactive Protein,C-Reactive Protein is a blood marker that can help indicate the level of inflammation in the body.,"CRP is produced in the liver primarily in response to increased levels of a pro-inflammatory molecule called interleukin-6.
Levels of CRP can increase with abdominal obesity, peridontal disease, smoking and high blood pressure.
New studies have demonstrated that elevated CRP is a greater risk factor than high cholesterol in predicting heart attack and
stroke. Early manifestations of these risks, such as obesity and insulin resistance, affect cells in a way that increases
inflammation, so we can use CPR readings to prevent disease states before they become full-blown.
What causes increased CRP?
All of the following have been found to cause elevations in C-reactive protein levels and are associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease, stroke, Ml)
© Diet - An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that eating too much saturated fat or high-glycemic carbohydrates
increases C-reactive protein.
© Periodontal disease - Published studies show that people with destructive gum disease almost double their risk of heart
attack. These studies indicate that in response to periodontal therapy, C-reactive protein levels decline dramatically.
Recommend good oral hygiene practices to your patients as a way to prevent the onset or progression of cardiovascular
disease. Unfortunately, instead of recommending periodontal therapy to patients, many cardiologists now prescribe
higher doses of statin drugs to lower CRP.

Creatine Kinase (CK),"Creatine Kinase (CPK) is a group of enzymes found in skeletal muscle, the brain, and the heart muscle. Damage to one or more
of these tissues will liberate CPK into the serum thus raising serum levels. Decreased levels of Creatine Kinase may be seen in
the chronic stage of muscle atrophy. Increased levels of CPK are associated with muscle damage or breakdown, damage to the
heart muscle as in an acute MI, heavy exercise, and brain damage or inflammation.","Creatine Kinase (CPK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of ATP into ADP a process that liberates high energy

Creatinine,"Serum creatinine reflects the end product of muscle metabolism, cleared by the kidneys. An elevated serum creatinine
commonly signals impaired kidney function or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Additional contributing factors may
include urinary tract obstruction, prostatic disease, or significant muscle injury that increases creatinine production. Evaluating
the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, estimated GFR, and additional markers such as cystatin C can help clarify the etiology of
creatinine elevation and guide appropriate management. A low serum creatinine can result from reduced muscle mass or
conditions associated with muscle wasting. While low creatinine typically does not indicate kidney dysfunction, correlating
these findings with patient history, body composition, and other renal parameters can help differentiate normal variation from
possible underlying pathologies such as malnutrition or sarcopenia.","Creatinine is a by-product of muscle creatine phosphate breakdown during muscle contraction. Creatine phosphate acts as a
storage depot for muscle energy.

Serum Creatinine levels are affected by the muscle mass of the individual. Patients with increased muscle mass may have
slightly higher creatinine levels while patients with decreased muscle mass (older adults and children) may have lower levels.
Creatinine, unlike BUN, is not affected by gender or the amount of dietary protein consumed. Conditions that cause excess
protein breakdown (tissue destruction, inflammation, cancer etc.) will not cause increased creatinine levels.

Creatinine is a more specific and sensitive test indicator of renal disease than BUN.

Creatinine levels above 1.1 can be used as a prognostic indicator for potential problems in the prostate (Benign Prostatic
Hypertrophy). This is more likely if other causes for a creatinine increase have been ruled-out e.g. renal disease, prescription
drugs.",0.4,1.5,35.36,132.6,0.8,1.1,70.72,97.24,mg/dL,umol/L,"Muscle Atrophy/Nerve-Muscle Degeneration
Due to its connection to muscle metabolism serum creatinine will be decreased in cases of muscle atrophy or nerve-muscle
degeneration.","Prostatic Dysfunction

An increased serum creatinine is associated with dysfunction of prostatic origin (Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy - BPH,
prostatitis) or a chronic inflammatory/infectious process (chronic UTIs). Suspect BPH if there is an increased creatinine level
along with a normal BUN and electrolytes, and an increased monocyte count and LDH isoenzyme #4, which has a prostatic
origin.

Renal disease

Consider impaired renal function due to a potential renal disease with an serum creatinine, an increased BUN, a
BUN/Creatinine ratio between 10-20, a urine specific gravity between 1.010 - 1.016, an increased uric acid, an increased serum
phosphorous, an increased LDH, and an increased AST.

Creatinine Clearance,"Creatinine Clearance is used to help evaluate the rate and efficiency of kidney filtration, also referred to as glomerular filtration
rate (GFR). It is used to help detect and diagnose kidney dysfunction and/or the presence of decreased blood flow to the
kidneys.","Creatinine Clearance is defined as that volume of plasma from which a measured amount of substance could be completely
eliminated into the urine per unit of time. Daily creatinine production is fairly constant except when there is massive injury to
muscle.

Glomerular filtration rate declines about 10% per decade after age 50. Some patients with significant impairment of glomerular
filtration rate have only slightly elevated serum creatinine. Creatinine clearance is calculated on the basis of the surface area of
the patient.",75,125,75,125,85,125,85,125,mL/min,mL/min,"Kidney Dysfunction and Reduced Filtration

Any disease or condition that affects the glomeruli can decrease the kidneys’ ability to clear creatinine and other wastes out of
the blood. When this occurs, the blood creatinine level will be increased and the creatinine clearance will be decreased
because not as much creatinine is able to be excreted in the urine. A number of diseases and conditions can affect kidney
function.

Reduced Renal Blood Flow

A decreased creatinine clearance rate may also occur when there is decreased blood flow to the kidneys as may occur with
congestive heart failure, obstruction within the kidney, or acute or chronic kidney failure. The less effective the kidney filtration,
the greater the decrease in clearance.","Increased creatinine clearance may occasionally be seen during pregnancy, exercise, and with diets high in meat.",,,,,,,
Cystatin C,"Cystatin C is a small protein made by almost all cells in the body. Cystatins in general serve a protective role as cysteine
protease inhibitors. Cystatin C is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys at a consistent rate and is considered a biomarker of
kidney function. Blood levels of cystatin C are correlated with glomerular filtration rate, the rate at which the kidney is able to
filter out metabolic compounds and wastes. As kidney filtration and function decline, levels of cystatin C increase. Cystatin C is
also a marker for cardiovascular disease and inflammation.","Measuring cystatin C may be a better tool for monitoring and diagnosing kidney function than measuring serum creatinine, a
marker that is highly dependent on muscle mass. Cystatin C levels are minimally affected by muscle mass, gender, age, race,
infections, circadian rhythm, or diet.

Cystatin C is especially more reliable than creatinine in cases of liver cirrhosis, critical illness, obesity, malnutrition,
vegetarianism, amputations, and reduced muscle mass (common in children and the elderly).

Ideally, both cystatin C and creatinine levels are taken into account when assessing kidney function, especially in those with
reduced GFR (45-59 mL/min) without obvious signs of kidney damage. Cystatin C may be less reliable for assessing kidney
function in kidney transplant patients, uncontrolled thyroid disease, or corticosteroid use.",0.5,1,0.5,1,0.62,0.9,0.62,0.9,mg/L,mg/L,Decreased levels of cystatin C are associated with a higher glomerular filtration rate and better kidney function.,"Elevated cystatin levels may also be associated with cardiovascular disease; heart failure; venous thromboembolism, brain

best way to both evaluate adrenal function and determine the effects stress is having on overall health.

Diamine Oxidase Activity,"Diamine Oxidase (DAO) is the primary enzyme responsible for degrading dietary histamine in the gastrointestinal tract.
Histamine, a naturally occurring compound present in various foods, plays a role in immune response, gastric acid secretion,
and neurotransmission. However, excess histamine—whether from external sources (foods, beverages) or internal production—
can lead to uncomfortable or even serious reactions in sensitive individuals. DAO is produced by the intestinal lining, and
adequate levels are essential for metabolizing ingested histamine. If DAO levels or activity are insufficient, histamine can
accumulate, potentially causing symptoms like flushing, headaches, digestive disturbances, or skin reactions.","DAO activity is influenced by several factors, including genetic predisposition, gastrointestinal health, medications, and overall
inflammation in the gut. Individuals with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, or other chronic
gastrointestinal disorders may have reduced DAO due to damage or stress on the intestinal lining. Certain pharmacological
agents—particularly those that block DAO or otherwise disturb its function—can also contribute to lower enzyme activity.
When DAO levels are low, patients often experience histamine intolerance, presenting with symptoms that mimic allergic
reactions but may not respond to standard allergy treatments. These manifestations can range from mild (occasional bloating
or flushing) to more severe (migraine-like headaches, hives, or persistent gastrointestinal discomfort). Managing histamine
intolerance typically involves a multifaceted approach: limiting dietary histamine (e.g., aged cheeses, fermented foods),

eAG,"Estimated Average Glucose (eAG) represents the average daily glucose levels over a 2- to 3-month period. The eAG is
calculated using Hemoglobin AIC, which measures the amount of hemoglobin bound to glucose due to elevated blood sugar.
Higher eAG levels are linked to an increased hemoglobin AIC and indicate a trend towards pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome,
insulin resistance, and diabetes.","Hemoglobin AIC has fast become a standard test in the assessment of glucose dysregulation, metabolic dysglycemia, pre-
diabetes and diabetes and as a tool to monitor treatment.

Information published in Diabetes Care affirmed that there's a linear relationship with hemoglobin AIC levels and an average
blood glucose level across the 120 or so days that the HGBAIC is measuring protein glycation.

The idea is that reporting glucose control as ‘average glucose’ will assist you, the health care provider, and your patients in
being able to better interpret the AIC value in units similar to what your patients see regularly through their self-monitoring.
Part of the logic for choosing the term “eAG” is that the medical community recently adopted another new term, eGFR, for
estimated glomerular filtration rate, which was introduced as an easier to understand the measure of kidney function than the
established method of measuring creatinine levels to assess kidney function. The hope is that the growing acceptance of
eGFR will help spur the adoption of the similar eAG.

eAG - Some Caveats

Given that we are looking at averages over time, it is possible to have good HgB-AIC and eAG levels and have poor glucose
management. A patient can have high levels of glucose followed by low levels of glucose over the 120 day period. Average
these together and things may look better than they actually are.",82,154,4.55,8.55,85,105,4.72,5.83,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Hypoglycemia

A consistently low estimated average glucose may indicate a tendency toward hypoglycemia, including that induced by
medications. Patients who undertake effective nutrition and lifestyle changes may reduce their need for glucose-lowering
medications and should be monitored closely.","Diabetes

Estimated average glucose has a linear relationship with HbAIC as demonstrated in the AlC-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG)
study. An eAG above 137 mg/dL (7.6 mmol/L) indicates diabetes. HbAIC and eAG had a stronger associated with preprandial
than postprandial blood glucose in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Although eAG maybe useful for long term glycemic management, it may not reflect extreme highs and lows over the 2-3
month period.

Insulin resistance

Insulin resistance with accompanying elevated blood glucose may present with elevated eAG levels over time.

Metabolic Syndrome

The clustering of risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity)
increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. An increasing eAG suggests an increasing
progression toward type 2 diabetes.

Pre-diabetes

An estimated glucose of 117-137 mg/dL (6.5-7.6 mmol/L) indicates impaired glucose tolerance and will likely progress to
diabetes without nutrition and lifestyle intervention.

Cardiovascular risk

Hyperglycemia increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Estimated average glucose and HbAIC have a stronger association with CVD risk than fasting blood glucose, postprandial
glucose, or glucose variability in diabetics.

Elevated HbAIC was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and hs-CRP, as well as lower HDL.",,,,,,,

Estradiol - Female,"Estradiol (E2), the most commonly measured estrogen among estrone (E1) and estriol (E3), is primarity produced by the
ovaries. This hormone plays a pivotal role in several areas, from regulating the menstrual cycle and nurturing female
reproductive tissues to maintaining bone health. In women of reproductive age, low estradiol levels might point to conditions
like ovarian failure, Turner syndrome, or hypothalamic amenorrhea, resulting in symptoms such as irregular periods, hot flashes,
and vaginal dryness. Persistently low estradiol can also elevate the risk of osteoporosis, given its significance in bone density.
On the flip side, high estradiol levels in reproductive-aged women may indicate conditions like ovarian or estrogen-producing
tumors, early puberty, and occasionally polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). While a decline in estradiol is expected in
postmenopausal women due to reduced ovarian function, unusually low or high levels in this stage might necessitate further
medical examination.","Estradiol is produced from testosterone and estrone from androstenedione where 98% of it circulates bound to sex hormone
binding globulin (SHBG).
Due to its potency estradiol plays a critical role in the following:

© Female sexual development

© Menstrual function

© Protein synthesis

© Cardiovascular function

© Bone formation and remodeling

© Cognitive function

© Emotional balance and other important health factors

Osteoporosis and Bone Fractures

Low levels of estradiol can be a risk factor for osteoporosis and bone fracture. Researchers at the Creighton University School

with low levels of bone mineral density in the femur, spine, and total body.

estradiol in men are associated with abdominal obesity, an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin sensitivity, and

Ferritin,"Ferritin is the main storage form of iron in the body. Decreased levels are strongly associated with iron deficiency where it is
the most sensitive test to detect an iron deficiency. Increased levels are associated with iron overload, an increasing risk of
cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and oxidative stress.","Decreased serum ferritin levels parallel tissue ferritin levels, which in turn reflects the decreased iron storage found in
iron deficiency anemia. In most situations the serum ferritin level will occur before changes in serum iron, development of
anemia, or changes in RBC morphology. The body will do whatever it takes to keep the serum levels of iron at an optimal level.",16,232,16,232,45,79,45,79,ng/mL,ug/L,"Anemia- iron deficiency

If ferritin and serum iron levels are decreased alongside a drop in % transferrin saturation, iron deficiency anemia is likely to be
present. A Complete Blood Count (CBC) can confirm this, which may show reductions in Red Blood Cell (RBC) count, Mean
Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC),
Hemoglobin (HGB), and Hematocrit (HCT), along with an increase in Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW). In cases where Total
lron Binding Capacity (TIBC) is increased, it’s possible that microscopic bleeding is occurring, which should be investigated
further with a reticulocyte count, urinalysis, or stool analysis. If serum phosphorous levels are decreased and serum globulin
levels are fluctuating, either increased or decreased, it’s possible that the iron deficiency anemia is secondary to
hypochlorhydria.

Hypoferritinemia Without Anemia

Hypoferritinemia can also be seen without anemia (HWA), in which RBCs, hemoglobin, and CBC in general are within range.
This condition may present with classic symptoms of fatigue, general weakness, hair loss, and depression despite a normal
CBC (Al-Jafar 2017).

Vitamin C/Ascorbate Insufficiency

Low serum ferritin may also be associated with vitamin C/ascorbate insufficiency and hypothyroidism (Knovich 2009).
Ascorbate increases iron absorption by making it soluble at a variety of gastrointestinal pH levels and its insufficiency can
jeopardize iron absorption (Skolmowska 2022).

Hypothyroidism

In hypothyroidism, iron absorption may be impaired by increased production of hepcidin, a peptide hormone that blocks iron
absorption (Garofalo 2023).","Hemochromatosis/ hemosiderosis/iron overload

Hemochromatosis is a condition caused by excessive absorption of iron, resulting in an accumulation of surplus iron in the
body's tissues, predominantly the liver. Laboratory tests may reveal various changes, such as an elevation in serum iron and
ferritin levels, a reduction in Total lron Binding Capacity (TIBC), and an increase in the percentage of transferrin saturation. The
AST levei may also be elevated.

Excess consumption of iron

Excess consumption of iron can come from a number of different sources: Elevated levels of iron in the drinking water, Iron
cookware, especially when used to cook acidic foods e.g. tomatoes, Consumption of iron containing supplements. All of the
above are often the reason for an increased serum iron and an increased ferritin.

Cardiovascular Risk

Low ferritin is the best measure of iron deficiency but most people do not know that elevated ferritin is an important maker of
cardiovascular health. High levels are found in inflammation, ischemic heart disease, iron overload (hemosiderosis), and
hemochromatosis, the genetic disease that causes iron to be deposited into the tissue. When the transferrin saturation rate,
transferrin iron binding capacity, and serum iron are all normal, then a high serum ferritin indicates inflammation, not
hemochromatosis.

Inflammation/ liver dysfunction/ oxidative stress

Serum ferritin is one of a group of proteins that can become increased in response to inflammation, infection, or trauma.
Elevations can last for weeks. Elevated ferritin along with normal serum iron is suggestive of inflammation, liver dysfunction, or
oxidative stress.

Insulin Resistance in Menopause

Ferritin can increase significantly in menopause and be associated with increased fasting glucose and insulin resistance.","• Severe protein deficiency

Fibrinogen Activity,"Fibrinogen is one of the principal blood clotting proteins. It is produced in the liver and liver disease and dysfunction can
cause a decrease in the level of circulating fibrinogen. Levels increase with tissue inflammation or tissue destruction. Elevated
fibrinogen levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke. Fibrinogen levels are
often elevated in patients suffering from cancer, especially colon cancer.","Fibrinogen Activity evaluates how much time it takes for fibrinogen to form a clot. Thrombin is added to a prepared blood
sample to stimulate the coagulation process in a test tube. The amount of fibrinogen incorporated into the blood clot is called
active (or functional) fibrinogen. Most labs offer a clotting-based activity test (functional) and report the results as milligrams
per deciliter (mg/dL).
Fibrinogen is a very important test in predicting cancer development or progression. Fibrogen is the precursor of fibrin.
Research suggests that cancer cells use fibrin to coat themselves in order to slow down their recognition by the immune
system.
Like D-dimer, fibrogen can also be a good predictor of blood clots. Patients with cancer often show a hyper-coagulation state
with elevated fibrinogen playing a major role. Anti-coagulant drugs such as heparin, which break down fibrin in the body, have
been shown to improve survival rates.
With the appropriate stimulation (injury or stress) fibrinogen is acted upon by an enzyme called thrombin, which in the
presence of calcium converts the fibrinogen into a substance called fibrin. Thousands of fibrin threads enmesh the platelets,
blood cells, and plasma at the injury site to form the clot itself.
Some ways that fibrinogen increases risk of heart disease

1. Binding to LDL- Fibrinogen may actually contribute to atherosclerosis by binding to LDL and stimulating the

proliferation of smooth muscle, thus disrupting the endothelial lining of arteries

2. Conversion to fibrin- Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin which may promote the formation of abnormal blood clots
inside coronary arteries
3. Decreased blood flow- Elevated fibrinogen may decrease blood flow by increasing the blood’s viscosity, especially
through blocked arteries
4. Facilitating platelet aggregation- Fibrinogen binds to certain platelet membrane receptor sites causing platelet
aggregation inside blood vessels, thus initiating occlusive arterial blood clots
Drugs that may increase fibrinogen levels include birth control pills and estrogen.",175,425,5.14,12.5,175,300,5.14,8.82,mg/dL,umol/L,Fibrinogen levels may decreased with liver disease or liver dysfunction.,"High levels of Fibrinogen can predict risk of heart attack and stroke since atherosclerosis and heart disease are inflammatory
processes. High levels are also seen in other inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and glomerulonephritis. High
levels are also a strong risk factor for the development of peripheral arterial disease and can be associated with increased
mortality in patients with this disease. Fibrinogen is one of the best markers to check for increased risk of MI, stroke and
vascular diseases.",,,"Birth control pills, Estrogen",,Drugs that may increase fibrinogen levels include birth control pills and estrogen.,,
Folate - RBC,"Folate functions as a coenzyme in the process of methylation. Atong with vitamin B12, folate is essential for DNA synthesis.
Low folate intake can result in folate deficiency, which can impair methylation, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell production.","Folate is a member of the B complex family of vitamins and is also known as vitamin BQ. It plays an important role in the white
blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) formation, brain development and function, DNA synthesis, cell division, amino acid
metabolism, methylation, and cell and tissue repair. A deficiency or insufficiency of folate contributes to megaloblastic
macrocytic anemia (oversized, underdeveloped RBCs), elevated homocysteine, mood and behavioral changes, and fetal neural
tube defects.

Guidelines suggest testing folate status in individuals with maldigestion or malabsorption, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, jejunal/ileal bypass, damage to the upper small intestine; malnutrition, alcoholism, altered mental state, dementia,
neuropsychiatric disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, hemolytic disorders, anemia, and abnormal complete blood count
results. RBC folate can be measured initially or as a follow up to low serum folate.

Folate is found in its natural form in food (e.g. leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits) and synthetic form (folic acid) in
supplements and fortified foods. Folic acid is not biologically active and must be converted into folate. Folate intake accounts
for only 20% of absorbed folate, the remaining 80% comes from microorganism production in the gastrointestinal tract.

Red blood cell folate is less sensitive to daily changes in intake, most closely reflects tissue stores, and may be a better
diagnostic tool for assessing folate status. Fasting samples are preferred. Genetic differences may require some individuals to
consume greater quantities of folate to restore serum and RBC folate concentrations.

Folate - Serum,"Folate functions as a coenzyme in the process of methylation. Along with vitamin B12, folate is essential for DNA synthesis.
Low folate intake can result in folate deficiency, which can impair methylation, DNA synthesis and red blood cell production.","Folates are compounds of pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) that function as coenzymes in metabolic reactions involving the transfer
of single-carbon units from a donor to a recipient compound. Folate, with vitamin B12, is essential for DNA synthesis, which is
required for normal red biood cell maturation. Humans obtain folate from dietary sources including fruits, green and leafy
vegetables, yeast, and organ meats. Folate is absorbed through the small intestine and stored in the liver.
Low folate intake, malabsorption as a result of gastrointestinal diseases, pregnancy, and drugs such as phenytoin are causes of
folate deficiency. Folate deficiency is also associated with chronic alcoholism. Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency impair DNA
synthesis, causing macrocytic anemias. These anemias are characterized by abnormal maturation of red blood cell precursors
in the bone marrow, the presence of megaloblasts, and decreased red blood cell survival.
Since both folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause macrocytic anemia, appropriate treatment depends on the differential
diagnosis of the deficiency. A serum folate concentration of less than 3 ng/mL is considered to represent clinical deficiency by
the World Health Organization and numerous subsequent clinical studies. Serum folate measurement provides an early index
of folate status; however, folate is much more concentrated in red blood cells than in serum so the red blood cell folate
measurement more closely reflects tissue stores. Erythrocytes incorporate folate as they are formed, and levels remain
constant throughout the life span of the cell. RBC folate levels are less sensitive to short-term dietary effects than are serum
folate levels. Red blood cell folate concentration is considered the most reliable indicator of folate status.

Free T3 : Free T4,"Measuring Free T3 (FT3) and Free T4 (FT4) hetps assess how much free and active thyroid hormone is available for use.
Calculating the ratio of FT3 to FT4 can provide further information about the current thyroid status.

An elevated FT3 : FT4 ratio is usually due to an increase in Free T3 and can be associated with a variety of conditions
including hyperactive thyroid, Graves’ disease, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and fatty liver, as well as adipose-related
inflammatory markers. In certain situations, an elevated ratio may also be associated with an emerging hypothyroidism.

A reduced FT3 : FT4 ratio may indicate the use of T4-only therapy, hypothyroidism, reduced production of T3 and free T3, or
increased risk of mortality in critically ill patients.","Thyroid hormones take a front and center role in regulating metabolism, directiy affecting energy expenditure, weight
maintenance, lipid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and growth and development.

The thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) is technically a prohormone with very little functional activity of its own. The
metabolically active form is triiodothyronine (T3) and, as its name implies, it contains three molecules of iodine (triiodo-). It is
produced when one iodine molecule is removed from T4.

Although a small amount of T3 is produced within the thyroid gland, most are derived from the conversion of T4 to T3. This
conversion occurs primarily in the liver, kidney, and thyroid but also takes place in the brain, pituitary, intestine, skin, brown
adipose tissue, bone, endothelial cells, and skeletal muscle.

Most circulating thyroid hormones are bound to proteins as they travel through the bloodstream and can be measured as total
T4 and total T3. However, only free unbound hormone is available for use. For example, T3 must be released from serum
proteins as free T3 before it can exert its effects on target tissues. Measuring both Free T3 (FT3) and Free T4 (FT4) helps
assess actual hormone availability.

Calculating the ratio of FT3 to FT4 can provide further information about the current thyroid status. The Free T3:Free T4 ratio
(FT3:FT4 ratio) reflects the conversion of T4 to T3. This process is dependent on selenium-containing deiodinase enzymes,
making selenium a key player in thyroid function right alongside iodine. Adequate selenium intake of 60-75 ug/day is needed
to maintain selenoenzyme activity and prevent destructive autoimmune activity in the thyroid gland.

Inflammation can disrupt deiodinase activity, alter thyroid hormone levels, and affect ratios. Under certain circumstances, a
specialized deiodinase will convert T4 to reverse T3 to curb metabolism. Such conditions include chronic inflammation, critical
illness, stress, myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, cancer, and starvation.

Increased FT3:FT4 ratio

An elevated FT3:FT4 ratio, reflecting increased free T3 and/or decreased free T4, can be associated with a variety of
conditions. These include Graves’ disease, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and fatty liver.

An increased FT3:FT4 can also be an indicator of cardiovascular risk as it positively correlates with pulse wave velocity and
adipose-related cardiovascular inflammatory markers interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity CRP.

Research suggests that an elevated FT3:FT4 ratio may be predictive of metabolic syndrome. Results from the Dutch
population-based LifeLines Cohort study of 26,719 men and women revealed that increases in the FT3:FT4 ratio were
associated with four of five defining components of metabolic syndrome (i.e. blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides,
and waist circumference but not fasting blood glucose). Subjects in the highest quartiles of FT3:FT4 ratio had a 50-80%
increased risk of metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quartile. Mean baseline FT3:FT4 ratio was 2.88 for men and 2.75
for women (FT3 in pg/mL and FT4 in ng/dL).

A cross-sectional study of 132,346 male and female euthyroid participants within a single institution determined that both
FT3:FT4 ratio and TSH were positively associated with markers for insulin resistance and parameters of metabolic syndrome.
Specifically, FT3:FT4 positively correlated with HOMA-IR, waist circumference, triglyceride levels, fasting blood glucose, and
systolic blood pressure. Interestingly, the FT3 to FT4 ratio had a stronger association with metabolic syndrome risk than did
TSH. Highest values for FT3:FT4 ratio were 2.98 or higher for men and 2.89 or higher for women (FT3 in pg/mL, FT4 in ng/dL)
and 0.358 or higher for men, 0.346 or higher for women using SI pmol/L for both FT3 and FT4.

Analysis of the FT3:FT4 ratio in an ongoing population study of male and female euthyroid adults revealed a close association
between an increasing ratio, metabolic anomalies, and cardiovascular risk factors.

In this study, FT3:FT4 ratio positively correlated with characteristic components of metabolic syndrome such as waist
circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and fasting blood glucose. It also correlated
positively with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, IL-6, and hs-CRP. The ratio was negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol.
The mean FT3:FT4 ratio was 2.5 for men and 2.3 for women using FT3 in pg/mL, FT4 in ng/dL. The mean ratios using pmol/L
for FT3 and FT4 were 0.3 for men and 0.29 for women.

Decreased FT3:FT4 ratio

A reduced FT3:FT4 ratio may indicate the use of T4 only therapy, hypothyroidism, selenium deficiency, disrupted deiodinase
activity, and reduced production of T3 and free T3. A ratio of less than 2 suggests the presence of low T3 syndrome.

Critical illness, inflammation, and hypoxia may interfere with the conversion of T4 to T3 and increase the degradation of T4,
essentially leading to a rise in FT3:FT4 ratios.

Low free T3 can be a sensitive marker of ill health and both a decreased FT3 and an increased FT4 correlate with acute and
chronic disease and help predict long-term mortality risk. Results from a retrospective cohort analysis of male and female
adults revealed that those with a lower FT3:FT4 ratio of 2.1 (FT3 in pg/mL and FT4 in ng/dL) were at increased risk of
mortality during a follow-up period of 36 months. It was noted that CRP, sedimentation rate, ferritin, and LDH were also
elevated in the mortality group.

The FT3:FT4 ratio can be useful in the assessment of cardiovascular risk as well. The heart and cardiovascular system are
profoundly affected by thyroid hormones. Subclinical hypothyroidism is strongly correlated with atherosclerosis, atrial
fibrillation, infarct size, and increased mortality in cardiac disease. The relationship between FT3:FT4 ratio and cardiovascular
mortality were investigated in a prospective cohort study of 953 euthyroid male and female adults undergoing percutaneous
coronary intervention after acute MI. The study observed that a decreasing FT3:FT4 ratio increased the likelihood of 1-year all-
cause mortality by 255%.

Since both low T3 and selenium insufficiency contribute to heart disease, the association should be studied further in order to
enhance the diagnostic value of readily available biomarkers and optimize clinical and nutrition interventions.",2.2,2.9,2.2,2.9,2.4,2.7,2.4,2.7,ratio,ratio,"Thyroid Conversion Syndrome or Low T3 Syndrome

Thyrotoxicosis- Graves’ disease

Calculating the ratio of free T3 to free T4 can help differentiate Graves’ disease from subacute thyroiditis. A ratio of free
T3/free T4 greater than 4.4 suggests Graves’ disease whereas a ratio of 2.73 is suggestive of subacute thyroiditis in those with
thyroid dysfunction.

Metabolic Syndrome

2.75 for women (FT3 in pg/mL and FT4 in ng/dL).

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

Free T3 : Reverse T3,"The Free T3 to Reverse T3 is used to determine whether there are issues with thyroid hormone conversion. A high or optimal
ratio of Free T3 to Reverse T3 isn’t considered clinically significant. A low Free T3 to Reverse T3 is a sign of Thyroid Hormone
Conversion Syndrome, a situation where the peripheral conversion of T4 into the more metabolically active T3 is decreased.","The ratio of Free T3 to Reverse T3 can tell you what’s happening at the tissue level because it helps determine how effective
thyroid conversion from T4 into active T3 really is.

Production of Reverse T3, a non-metabolically active form of thyroid hormone, often increases during times of stress such as
severe trauma; shock; surgery; severe infection or burns; critical illness; liver dysfunction; starvation; anorexia nervosa; and
chronic stress. The phenomenon of increased Reverse T3 without the presence of thyroid disease may be referred to as “sick
euthyroid” syndrome or “non-thyroidal illness.”

In such cases, there is less conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver. Instead, there is increased conversion of T4 to T3 in the
periphery... peripheral production of T3 yields more Reverse T3. This action is believed to reduce metabolic activity and
conserve energy as the body fights the stressor.

As production of Reverse T3 increases, levels of metabolically active T3 can decline, creating a decrease in the ratio of Free T3
to Reverse T3. It is important to recognize that these changes may be due to factors other than thyroid disease and may not
require thyroid medication.

Many Functional Medicine practitioners are in agreement that a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio of > 20 is ideal. This is basically
saying that you want at least 20 times as much Free T3 to Reverse T3 to be in the best health. However, if Free T3 is elevated
then this can make the ratio look healthier than it is. This is seen in people taking T3 medication.

Some practitioners say anything over 2 is optimal but a ratio between 10 - 20 is preferable with a value > 20 being ideal.",2,28,2,28,10,28,10,28,ratio,ratio,"Thyroid Hormone Conversion Syndrome

A decreased Free T3 to Reverse T3 is a sign of Thyroid Hormone Conversion Syndrome, a situation where the peripheral
conversion of T4 into the more metabolically active T3 is decreased. In this syndrome, T3 levels are usually low and the
conversion of T4 moves more in the direction of producing more Reverse T3 than Free T3. Low Free T3 and an increased
Reverse T3 cause a decreased Free TS to ReverseT3 Ratio.

Stress, high serum cortisol

Increased stress accompanied by increased serum cortisol may be associated with a decrease in free T3 and an increase in
reverse T3, resulting in a low ratio of free T3 to reverse T3.

Oxidative Stress

Cytokine activity, inflammation, and oxidative stress cause a decrease in free T3 and an increase in reverse T3. Therefore, the
ratio of free T3 to reverse T3 decreases with inflammation, oxidative stress, and antioxidant insufficiency.",A high or optimal ratio of Free T3 to Reverse T3 isn’t considered clinically significant.,"• Dysbiosis
Approximately 20% of T4 is converted to TS by healthy bacteria in the intestines. However, an imbalance
between healthy and unhealthy bacteria (dysbiosis) can reduce the production of T3. Dysbiosis and
related inflammation can also increase the production of cortisol which can increase the production of
reverse T3 causing a decreased Free T3 to Reverse T3 Ratio.
• Metabolic Stress, Catabolic state
Severe trauma, starvation, severe infection/trauma, inflammatory bowel disease, and catabolic conditions
may be associated with a relative increase in Reverse T3 causing a decreased Free T3 to Reverse T3 Ratio.
The increase in inactive Reverse T3 may occur as the body attempts to reduce metabolic activity and conserve energy.

pharmacotherapy—may need reevaluation. When fructosamine is low, it typically shows well-managed glycemia or, in some

FSH - Male,"Follicte-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary and plays a pivotal role in the male reproductive
system by stimulating Sertoli cells in the testes to support spermatogenesis. FSH works synergistically with luteinizing
hormone (LH) to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and maintain normal testosterone levels. In
functional medicine clinics, where many patients are on testosterone therapy, FSH measurement is used to assess endogenous
testicular function and the overall status of the HPG axis.","Interpretation of serum FSH levels in male patients requires an understanding of both the underlying physiology and the
effects of exogenous testosterone. In patients not on testosterone therapy, low FSH levels may point to anterior pituitary
dysfunction, whereas elevated FSH levels typically indicate primary testicular failure or an age-related decline in testicular
function (andropause). In contrast, for patients receiving testosterone therapy, the exogenous hormone often suppresses the
natural production of FSH due to negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary. Consequently, low FSH levels in these
patients may simply reflect the pharmacologic effect of the therapy rather than an intrinsic pituitary disorder. However, if FSH
levels remain high despite testosterone supplementation, this may signal that the testes are not responding appropriately—
suggesting a primary testicular dysfunction or hypogonadism that is not corrected by external testosterone. Thus, a
comprehensive evaluation of the HPG axis, including measurements of LH, total and free testosterone, and estradiol, is critical
in the context of testosterone therapy.",1.4,12.8,1.4,12.8,1.6,8,1.6,8,mIU/mL,IU/L,"Testosterone Therapy Effect

A decreased FSH level may result from intrinsic pituitary failure, leading to insufficient production of FSH and LH. This
condition is characterized by diminished stimulation of the testes and impaired spermatogenesis.","Primary Testicular Faiture and Hypogonadism

Elevated FSH is commonly seen in primary testicular failure, where the testes are unable to produce adequate sperm despite

HPG axis is part of the normal process of andropause and is often accompanied by changes in testosterone levels and other
metabolic parameters.

G6PD,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key enzyme in the hexose monophosphate shunt (also known as the
Pentose Phosphate Pathway PPP), helping red blood cells (RBCs) neutralize oxidative stress. G6PD deficiency can lead to
episodic hemolysis when individuals are exposed to oxidative triggers like certain drugs, infections, or foods (e.g.. fava beans).
Clinically, G6PD deficiency is an important consideration in populations with a higher prevalence (such as those of African,
Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent).","As mentioned in the background, the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme is utilized in the hexose
monophosphate shunt also known as the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP). This pathway generates NADPH. a critical
compound in glutathione metabolism, and, therefore, in antioxidant defense. Glutathione protects cells from free radical
damage, especially highly vulnerable red blood cells (Richardson 2021). The NADPH molecule is also used as a cofactor in
nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. A G6PD deficiency not only impairs synthesis of NO, but also causes hyperglycemia which can
increase advanced glycosylated end products which further impair nitric oxide activity (Gaskin 2001). NADPH is also an
important factor in the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, steroids, and DNA. NADPH can be generated by enzymes other
than G6PD in most cells but not in RBCs which are more susceptible to a deficiency of G6PD (Luzzatto 2016).

Ultimately, a deficiency of G6PD leaves cells, especially RBCs, susceptible to oxidative stress and results in inflammation,
hemolysis, and impaired endothelial and macrophage function. Hyperglycemia and glycosylation of proteins can further impair
G6PD activity (Jain 2020).

G6PD deficiency is the most common inborn error of metabolism and the most prevalent enzyme deficiency worldwide. It
contributes to hemolytic anemia and increased susceptibility to oxidative, metabolic, infectious, and degenerative diseases,
though the degree of deficiency depends on the genetic variant. In one study, low levels of G6PD were seen in Sjogren's
disease and even lower levels in rheumatoid arthritis, especially when coupled with metabolic syndrome. In this study, healthy
controls had a mean G6PD of 13.13 U/g Hb, while levels were 11.55 in Sjogren’s, 7.72 in rheumatoid arthritis, and 4.61 in those
with both rheumatoid arthritis and metabolic syndrome (Gheita 2014). These findings are not surprising given the role of G6PD
in countering oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.

The insufficiency of reduced glutathione that results from G6PD deficiency contributes to the oxidation of hemoglobin and
Heinz body formation (Nassef 2013). Heinz bodies are precipitates of denatured hemoglobin that results from excess oxidative
stress and hemolysis (Pagana 2021).

G6PD deficiency should be screened for in the neonatal period (Gheita 2014). In a sample of 24 newborns, the mean normal
G6PD level using standard methodology was 11.1 U/g Hb, while the mean level with G6PD deficiency was 1.4 U/g Hb (Bhutani
2015).

One 24-year-old individual with an undiagnosed G6PD deficiency (3.8 U/g Hb) presented with severe rhabdomyolysis,
metabolic acidosis, and significantly elevated bilirubin, AST, ALT, CRP. and ferritin (Eziokwu 2018). This case highlights the
importance of addressing G6PD deficiency as early as possible. The reference interval for G6PD in this case study was 8.6-18
U/g Hb.

Certain medications may trigger hemolysis in G6PD deficient individuals. A reduction in hemoglobin and an increase in
bilirubin in G6PD-deficient individuals taking low-dose aspirin following ischemic stroke may indicate the presence of
hemolysis and worsening outcomes (Chen 2021). Other medications may induce hemolytic anemia in those with G6PD
deficiency as well. Even high-dose vitamin C may need to be avoided in this group (Quinn 2017).

Consumption of fava beans and some synthetic dyes can precipitate hemolytic anemia in those with G6PD deficiency and
should be avoided (Lee 2017). Other foods, including falafel, chickpeas, and broad beans may also trigger hemolysis in those
with G6PD deficiency (Hagag 2018), Sulfites and quinine should also be avoided with a G6PD deficiency (Noland 2020).

A 2017 systematic review of 32 publications comprising 10 herbal! and dietary supplements found no or insufficient evidence of

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, is a genetic metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme
G6PD. G6PD deficiency causes the early destruction of red blood cells leading to hemolytic anemia. Many people with G6PD
feel fine but certain events (viral or bacterial infections, certain sulfa medications, certain antibiotics or eating fava/broad

Gamma Globulin,"Gamma-globulins comprise immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgD), which play a critical role in immune defense by
recognizing and neutralizing pathogens. This fraction appears as the “gamma band” during serum protein electrophoresis,
located furthest from the albumin band. Because gamma-globulins are produced primarily by plasma cells in response to
antigenic stimulation, levels can vary significantly depending on the presence of infections, autoimmune conditions, or
hematologic malignancies. Clinicians often measure total gamma-globulin levels while also performing immunofixation or
quantitative immunoglobulin assays to further characterize any abnormalities.","Low gamma-globulin (hypogammaglobulinemia) can arise from primary or secondary immunodeficiencies. In primary forms—
such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or X-linked agammaglobulinemia—patients have intrinsic defects in B-cell
function or immunoglobulin production, leading to a heightened susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. Secondary
causes include chronic illness, malnutrition, or drug-induced immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids), which can impair the
body's capacity to sustain adequate antibody levels. Confirming the specific immunoglobulin class deficiency (IgG, IgA, IgM) is
important for targeted treatment and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections.

High gamma-globulin (hypergammaglobulinemia) commonly represents an immune response to persistent antigenic
stimulation, such as chronic infections (e.g., hepatitis, HIV), autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus), or plasma cell dyscrasias. Monoclonal gammopathies—including multiple myeloma, Waldenstr6m
Macroglobulinemia, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)—manifest as sharply elevated levels of
a single immunoglobulin type (commonly IgG, IgA, or IgM), often visible as a “M-spike” on electrophoresis. In contrast,
polyclonal gammopathy shows a more diffuse increase in the gamma region, signaling a broad immune activation rather than
a single clone of plasma cells. Identifying whether hypergammaglobulinemia is monoctonal or polyclonal is a pivotal step for
accurate diagnosis and management.

Routine monitoring of gamma-globulin levels can provide insights into disease progression, therapeutic response, or the onset
of new immunologic challenges. For example, in patients with multiple myeloma, changes in the monoclonal protein level may
predict relapse or remission, while in autoimmune conditions, fluctuations in polyclonal gammopathy may indicate evolving
disease activity. By interpreting gamma-globulin patterns alongside clinical findings, imaging, and other labs—such as CRP,
ESR, or specific autoantibodies—clinicians gain a more complete understanding of a patient’s immune function and potential

Gastrin,"Gastrin is a hormone that stimulates the release of Hydrochloric Acid (HCL) from the parietal cells of the stomach. Increased
gastrin levels are associated with gastric inflammation, gastric and peptic ulcers and hypersecretion of HCL
(hyperchlorhydria). Decreased levels of gastrin are associated with hypochlorhydria or decreased secretion of HCL, pancreatic
insufficiency and biliary insufficiency.","Gastrin is a hormone produced by G cells in the plyloric antrum of the stomach that stimulates the release of Hydrochloric
Acid (HCL) from the parietal cells of the stomach. Gastrin also stimulates Chief Cells to secrete pepsinogen, the inactive form
of the digestive enzyme pepsin, induces the release of enzymes from the pancreas and plays a role in the release of bile from
the gallbladder.
Gastrin release is stimulated by the following stimuli:

1. The presence of partially digested proteins, polypeptides and individual amino acids in the lumen of the stomach

2. Distension or stretching of the antrum of the stomach by food

3. Hypercaicemia

4. An alkaline environment in the stomach

Gastrin release is inhibited by the following:`
1. The presence of acid in the form of HCL in the stomach. this is a classic negative feedback loop.

2. The presence of certain hormones inhibits the release of gastrin. These include:

• Somatostatin

• Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)
• Glucagon
• Calcitonin",0,100,0,48.1,45,90,21.64,43.29,pg/mL,pmol/L,"Hypochlorhydria

A decreased gastrin level is associated with a decreased production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach (hypochlorhydria).
Hypochlorhydria is also associated with an increased globulin level and a normal or decreased total protein and/or albumin, an
increased BUN, a decreased or normal total protein and/or albumin and/or decreased serum phosphorous. Other values that
may be reflective of a developing or chronic hypochlorhydria include an increased MCV and MCH, a decreased or normal
calcium and iron , a decreased chloride, and a decreased alkaline phosphatase.

Biliary insufficiency

A decreased gastrin level is associated with biliary insufficiency, which is a decreased output of bile from the gallbladder.
Biliary insufficiency is also associated with an elevated total bilirubin along with an increased alkaline phosphatase . GGTP, AST,
and ALT may be normal or increased. Cholesterol levels may be also increased but in many cases of gallbladder dysfunction
the cholesterol is decreased. Many cases of biliary insufficiency will show normal lab values. In these situations suspect biliary
insufficiency if there are strong subjective indicators.

Pancreatic insufficiency

A decreased gastrin level is associated with pancreatic insufficiency, which is a decreased output of pancreatic digestive
enzymes from the pancreas. Pancreatic insufficiency is also associated with a decreased WBC count, a decreased Albumin, an
increased total Globulin, an increased GGT, and a decreased BUN.","Gastric Inflammation

An increased gastrin level is associated with gastric inflammation. The pattern wilt be similar to that of hypochlorhydria but the
globulin may be decreased unless inflammation is severe. Many patients with the subjective and laboratory indications of HCi
need experience an aggravation of their symptoms when taking HCL supplementation. Patients with this type of reaction
probably have gastric inflammation due to a long-term HCL need. If inflammation is suspected or present, support the
digestive terrain to heal the inflammation appropriately for 3 to 4 weeks prior to initiating HCI therapy. Acute digestive
inflammation may tead to an increased globulin level due to the increased production of inflammatory immunoglobulins.
Chronic digestive inflammation due to colitis, enteritis, Crohn’s etc., will compromise protein breakdown and absorption,
leading to a widespread protein deficiency in the body and a decreased level of the inflammatory immunoglobulins, hence the
decreased total globulin level. Decreased total globulin, decreased serum phosphorous, increased BUN, increased basophils
and an increased ESR.

Gastric Ulcer

An increased gastrin level is associated with gastric ulcers. You may also find AST to be elevated. If bleeding is present, expect
to see an elevated TIBC and a decreased serum iron and ferritin level. If the bleeding is severe enough, you may also see a
decreased HCT, HGB and RBC count. If there is a concomitant Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, you may see an increase in
MCV and MCH.MCV and MCH will be increased due to vitamin B-12 and folic acid deficiency. Other values associated with this
pattern include a decreased albumin and an increased Alk phos, especially an increase in the intestinal isoenzyme, which will
be increased due to active tissue damage and/or ulceration.

Peptic Ulcer

The findings in peptic ulcers are similar to gastric ulcers with the exception that the gastrin level is generally increased above
the normal range. With a peptic ulcer, you may also see an increased ESR and a decreased chloride level.

GGT,"Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) is an enzyme that is present in highest amounts in the liver cells and to a lesser extent the
kidney, prostate, and pancreas. It is also found in the epithelial cells of the biliary tract. GGT will be liberated into the
bloodstream following cell damage or destruction and/or biliary obstruction. GGT is induced by alcohol and can be elevated
following chronic alcohol consumption and in alcoholism. Decreased levels are associated with vitamin B6 and magnesium
deficiency.","GGT is a much more sensitive and specific marker for hepatic dysfunction than serum ALP and ALT for some conditions
(cholangitis, cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice). GGT is generally increased above the other liver enzymes with biliary tree
problems (gall bladder, common bile duct, and pancreas), obstruction, or alcoholism.
GGT levels may be elevated by as high as 50% in patients with obesity.
An important aspect of GGT’s function is its role in the metabolism of Glutathione (GSH), a critical antioxidant in the body.
GGT is involved in the breakdown and reassembly of GSH, thereby playing a pivotal role in its recycling process. Elevated levels
of GGT may indicate a depletion of GSH within the body. Since GSH is vital for detoxifying harmful compounds, a decrease in
its levels due to elevated GGT activity could impair the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, leading to increased
susceptibility to cellular damage and various diseases. Thus, monitoring GGT levels not only helps in assessing liver function
and damage but also in understanding the body’s antioxidant capacity and potential vulnerabilities to oxidative stress.
GGT will also be elevated with alcohol use and is therefore used as a screen for the consequences of chronic alcoholism and to
detect alcohol-induced liver disease. GGT levels are normally not affected by moderate alcohol intake.
Men may present with high normal levels due to the large amounts of GGT found in the prostate",3,85,3,85,10,17,10,17,IU/L,IU/L,"B6 Deficiency

Vitamin Bé6, in its active form of pyridoxyl-5-phosphate (P-5-P), is essential for the effective operation of the transferase
enzymes. A deficiency in P-5-P from alcoholism, malnutrition, poor assimilation, deficiencies in the diet, etc. will cause
decreased levels of aminotransferase enzymes, such as AST in general circulation. B6 deficiency is likely if there is a decreased
AST and a concomitant deficiency in GGT and/or ALT, enzymes that also need B6 for optimum activity. B6 deficiency can also
impact red blood cell activity leading to a decreased MCV and/or MCH and a normal serum iron and ferritin level. This situation
leads to B6 deficiency anemia.

Magnesium need

A low GGT is associated with a need for magnesium. Magnesium levels can be assessed using RBC or serum magnesium levels.
Some of the clinical signs of a potential magnesium deficiency are: Muscle cramps, Chocolate craving, Chronic constipation,
Dysrhythmia.","Dysfunction located outside the liver and inside the biliary tree

If the GGT is increased above the levels of the ALT and AST consider that the problem or area of involvement is possible
outside the liver but inside the biliary tree (i.e. gall bladder, common bile duct, and pancreas).

Biliary obstruction

GGT levels rise when excretion is blocked by an obstruction somewhere in the biliary tree. Increased GGT along with an
increased alkaline phosphatase is seen with biliary tree involvement. There will usually be significant increases in GGT (greater
than 5 times higher than normal). If GGT and alkatine phosphatase are increased along with a normal or increased AST and
ALT, biliary obstruction with possible calculi is probable. Biliary obstruction with possible calculi becomes even more likely
with an increased total bilirubin and direct bilirubin.

Biliary stasis or insufficiency

Biliary stasis or insufficiency can often be caused by a mild obstruction in the extra-hepatic biliary duct. GGT levels will
frequently be increased but not necessarily. Bilirubin levels will also be elevated along with alkaline phosphatase and total
cholesterol. AST and ALT may be normal! or increased. Many cases of biliary stasis will show normal lab values. In these
situations suspect biliary stasis or insufficiency if there are strong subjective indicators.

Liver cell damage

Another common cause of an increased GGT level is active or acute liver cell damage (i.e. chronic/acute hepatitis, active
cirrhosis, infectious mononucleosis, hepatic necrosis, alcoholic hepatitis). There will usually be moderate increases in GGT 3-5
times higher than normal (200 - 300).

Excessive alcohol consumption, alcoholism

Increased GGT without an increase in the other liver enzymes suggests excessive alcohol consumption. If GGT is increased
along with an increased serum triglyceride level, excess alcohol use should be ruled out. Excessive alcohol use can seriously
affect the liver function, therefore we may also see elevated AST and ALT levels, but the GGT will usually be higher.

Acute or chronic pancreatitis

Suspect pancreatic pathology if the GGT is increased 5 times higher than the normal.

Pancreatic insufficiency
Mild to moderate chronic pancreatitis can lead to a pancreatic insufficiency over time. In these cases GGT levels may be mild
to moderately increased. One of the most significant contributing factors to pancreatic insufficiency is an accompanying
hypochlorhydria picture.","• Protein deficiency

Globulin - Total,"Globulins constitute the body’s antibody system and the Total serum globulin is a measurement of all the individual globulin
fractions in the blood. An elevated total globulin level is associated with hypochlorhydria, liver dysfunction, immune
activation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Decreased levels are associated with inflammation in the digestive system and
immune insufficiency.","Total Globulin is composed of individual globulin fractions called alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma fractions. The total globulin
level is greatly impacted by concomitant increases or decreases in one or more of these fractions. Globulins function to
transport substances in the blood and constitute the antibody system, clotting proteins, and complement. Globulins are
produced in the liver, the reticuloendothelial system, and other tissues.

Care must be taken when making a diagnosis based upon the total globulin alone because total globulin is composed of 4
different fractions. Inflammatory, degenerative, or infectious processes are associated with increased production of antibodies.
The total serum globulin is a useful way to assess these processes, as many antibodies are synthesized from globulins.

With accompanying subjective indicators, a total globulin can heip to confirm an underlying digestive problem of an
inflammatory or infectious nature. Secretory IgA levels are often decreased in these situations.

A serum protein electrophoresis should be completed when the total serum globulin exceeds 3.5 g/dl (35 g/L) or drops below
2.0 g/dl (20 g/L). Protein electrophoresis is an excellent method of identifying the specific globulin that is responsible for the
total serum globulin increase or decreases.",1.9,3.7,19,37,2.4,2.8,24,28,g/dL,g/L,"Digestive Inflammation/Gastritis

Suspect primary digestive inflammation or inflammation secondary to HCL insufficiency. The pattern will be similar to that of
hypochlorhydria but the globulin may be decreased unless inflammation is severe. Many patients with the subjective and
laboratory indications of HCl need experience an aggravation of their symptoms when taking HCL supplementation. Patients
with this type of reaction probably have gastric inflammation due to a long-term HCL need. If inflammation is suspected or
present, support the digestive terrain to heal the inflammation appropriately for 3 to 4 weeks prior to initiating HCI therapy.
Acute digestive inflammation may lead to an increased globulin level due to the increased production of inflammatory
immunoglobulins. Chronic digestive inflammation due to colitis, enteritis, Crohn's etc., will compromise protein breakdown and
absorption, leading to a widespread protein deficiency in the body and a decreased level of the inflammatory
immunoglobulins, hence the decreased total globulin level. Decreased total globulin, decreased serum phosphorous, increased
BUN, increased basophils, an increased gastrin and an increased ESR.

Immune insufficiency

A decreased total globulin suggests immune insufficiency. Suspect an increased use of globulin by the liver, spleen, thymus,
kidneys, or heart. Apart from known kidney or heart dysfunction, rule out a chronic immune disruptor (virus, xenobiotics,
toxicity etc.) and consider a serum protein electrophoresis test (look for a decreased gamma fraction) in the investigation of
immune insufficiency.","Hypochlorhydria

An increased total globulin level is often associated with a decreased production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach
(hypochlorhydria). Hypochlorhydria is associated with an increased globulin level and a normal or decreased total protein
and/or albumin, an increased BUN, a decreased serum phosphorous. Other values that may be reflective of a developing or
chronic hypochlorhydria include increased or decreased gastrin, an increased MCV and MCH, a decreased or normal calcium
and iron, a decreased chloride, and a decreased alkaline phosphatase.

Liver damage/infections

Increased levels of total globulin are often seen in conditions such as hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis. The body produces
increased levels of immunoglobulins in response to tissue and cellular damage, destruction, or infection. Rule out liver problem
or infection ALT, AST, GGTP, and serum protein electrophoresis. Consider fatty liver in obese patients or those with elevated
lipids. Rule out cirrhosis if elevated in conjunction with liver enzyme abnormalities.

Oxidative Stress

Suspect oxidative stress if the total globulin level is increased. If the total globulin level is increased along with a total
cholesterol level that is suddenly below its historical level and a decreased lymphocyte count, a decreased albumin and a
decreased platelet level, oxidative stress should be investigated. Oxidative stress can cause an increased destruction of red
blood cells; in these situations you may see an elevated bilirubin level.

Heavy metal/ Chemical toxicity

Chronic levels of chemical and/or heavy metal toxicity can lead to an elevation in total globulins due to the persistent low-level
tissue inflammation.

Immune Activation

The total globulin level constitutes the body's antibody system. It is composed of four fractions (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta and
gamma globulin). An increased level of total globulins can therefore indicate an increase in one or more of these fractions that
has been activated due to an infectious or inflammatory process. Many auto-immune conditions will first present with this
pattern.

Glucose Fasting,"Fasting blood glucose (FBG) is a critical indicator of metabolic status and reflects the intricate balance of glucose
homeostasis, primarily mediated by the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin facilitates cellular glucose uptake and inhibits
hepatic glucose production, while glucagon promotes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. Elevated FBG levels are
typically indicative of disrupted insulin activity or insufficient insulin secretion, commonly seen in conditions such as type 1
diabetes mellitus, where pancreatic beta-cell destruction leads to severe insulin deficiency, and type 2 diabetes mellitus,
characterized by insulin resistance and eventual pancreatic beta-cell exhaustion. Additionally, increased FBG can signal
underlying metabolic syndrome or prediabetic states, suggesting a broader spectrum of insulin resistance encompassing
impaired glucose tolerance and altered lipid metabolism. Decreased FBG levels might denote hypoglycemia, an acute
condition potentially resulting from excessive insulin administration in diabetic patients, inadequate nutritional intake, or
excessive alcohol consumption. It can also occur in the context of rare endocrine disorders, such as adrenal insufficiency or
certain pancreatic tumors (e.g., insulinoma), which abnormally increase insulin secretion independent of dietary glucose intake.","The level of glucose in the blood is primarily dependent on the liver, which exerts a considerable influence through the
breakdown of glycogen, and via the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that promote the gluconeogenesis of fats and
proteins. The regulatory mechanisms that help control blood glucose levels are complex, involving an intricate system of inter-
connecting hormones.

Insulin, secreted from the beta islet cells in the pancreas, transports glucose into the cells by increasing the permeability of
glucose through the cellular membrane. In addition, insulin stimulates fat, protein and glycogen synthesis. The sum of insulin
activity in the body is to decrease blood glucose levels.

Glucagon, on the other hand, acts on the liver to cause glycogen breakdown and thus serves to increase blood glucose levels.
Blood glucose levels are also influenced by a number of different hormones, including epinephrine, cortisol, thyroxine, which
tends to act on the liver to elevate blood glucose.
The test for blood sugar is used to detect disorders of metabolism that may be the result of one of several causes:
1. Inabitity of the beta islet cells of the pancreas to produce insulin.
2. Reduced number of insulin receptors on target cells (increased peripheral resistance)
3. Inability of the intestines to absorb glucose
4. Inability of the liver to accumulate and break down glycogen
5. The presence of increasing amounts of hormones that directly influence the liver e.g. ACTH, epinephrine, cortisol",65,99,3.61,5.5,75,86,4.16,4.77,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Hypoglycemia- reactive

A decreased fasting blood glucose along with a decreased LDH is a common finding in reactive hypoglycemia. Hemoglobin
AIC levels may also be decreased. LDH is an important enzyme for pyruvate metabolism in glycolysis and is associated with
pancreatic function and glucose metabolism.

Hypoglycemia- liver glycogen problem

A decreased ability of the liver to store and/or produce glycogen can be a major cause of fasting low blood glucose and
hypoglycemia, especially if ALT is high.

Hyperinsulinemia

A diet high in refined carbohydrates can lead to excessive secretion of insulin. High levets of circulating insutin
(hyperinsulinemia) can cause low blood glucose levels leading to hypoglycemia in its early stages. Later, as the cells become
resistant to insulin, levels of insulin and blood glucose will rise. Consider hyperinsulinemia with an increased fasting insulin, a
decreased blood gluose (in early stage) or increased blood glucose (advanced stages), an increased total cholesterol, an
increased triglyceride, a decreased HDL a decreased phosphorous. An increased simple sugar intake leads first to
hypoglycemia and later to diabetes. have demonstrated that the persistent consumption of refined sugars and the resulting
increase in blood insulin levels eventually lead to the development of type II diabetes.

Adrenal hypofunction

Adrenal fatigue leads to a decreased output of cortisol, a hormone that functions to increase blood sugar when blood sugar
levels are low. A decreased output of cortisol, as seen in adrenal fatigue, can cause a low fasting blood glucose level.","Insulin resistance (Early stage) and glucose intolerance

Research has shown that individuals progress through several stages of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance before
becoming a classic type II diabetic. The stages include: Normal glucose tolerance hypoglycemia (often due to
hyperinsulinemia) insulin insensitivity/resistance eventually overt type Ii diabetes. An increased fasting blood glucose level is a
sign that this individual is possibly in an insulin resistant phase, also known as a pre-diabetic state.

Early stage of Hyperglycemia/Diabetes

If serum glucose and Hemoglobin AIC are both above optimal, diabetes is probable. Serum triglycerides are often higher than
the total cholesterol in patients with diabetes. Urinary glucose may be increased, HDL levels decreased, and BUN and
creatinine frequently increased with the renal damage associated with diabetes. Follow-up with appropriate testing to confirm
the diagnosis, e.g. oral Glucose Insulin Tolerance Testing (GITT).

Metabolic Syndrome / insulin resistance

Metabolic Syndrome or hyperinsulinemia is a cluster of related symptoms: Increased triglycerides, increased total cholesterol,
decreased HDL cholesterol, obesity, increased blood insulin levels, increased glucose and increased blood pressure. The
hallmark of this syndrome is the insulin resistance that leads to high glucose levels and an imbalance in blood fats. The overall
effect is an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Thiamine (Vitamin B1) need

An increased glucose is associated with a thiamine need. Thiamine transports glucose across the blood brain barrier and is an
essential component in the enzymatic conversion of pyruvate into acetyl CoA that allows pyruvate to enter the Kreb’s cycle. If
glucose is increased and the hemoglobin AIC is normal, thiamine need is possible. If CO2 is decreased and the anion gap is
increased along with moderately high serum glucose, thiamine need is probable. Due to thiamine’s role in glycolysis, LDH levels
may be decreased.

Anterior Pituitary resistance to cortisol

During the decompensated/maladapted phase of the chronic stress response, the hypothalamus and pituitary become less
and less sensitive to cortisol, causing increased cortisol resistance. The net result is an increase in cortisol levels in the body
because the negative feedback loop that shuts cortisol production down is not activated. increased levels of circulating
cortisol will cause increased blood glucose levels through increased gluconeogenesis. Excess cortisol will also reduce the
utilization and uptake of glucose by the cell.

Acute stress

Increasing levels of stress cause the body to move into the chronic stress response. This is marked by an increased Cortisol to
DHEA ratio, which causes an increase in gluconeogenic activity and a concomitant rise in blood glucose levels. Excess cortisol
will also reduce the utilization and uptake of glucose by the cell.

Fatty liver (early development) and Liver congestion

High blood glucose levels have been associated with increased levels of blood fats, e.g. high total cholesterol, LDL and
triglycerides, low HDL. In individuals with liver congestion, this may lead to the deposition of fat in the liver and the
development of fatty liver.","• Pancreatic tumors

Glucose Non-Fasting,"Blood glucose non-fasting is a critical biomarker used to assess glucose levels in the bloodstream at any time, regardless of
food intake. Unlike fasting blood glucose tests, this biomarker provides a snapshot of your patient’s glucose levels in a non-
controlled state, offering valuable insights into the body's ability to manage glucose effectively under typical conditions.
Blood glucose levels fluctuate with food intake, rising after a meal and then returning to premeal levels under normal
circumstances. The inability to return glucose to a healthy baseline within 1-2 hours indicates glucose dysregulation. Prolonged
postprandial spikes or “excursions” in glucose levels are detrimental and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and
diabetes mellitus. These excursions may occur without a rise in fasting glucose in the early phases of insulin resistance and
diabetes. Therefore, non-fasting postprandial glucose levels should be evaluated periodically and monitored regularly in high-
risk individuals. A good rule of thumb is to limit postprandial glucose increases to no more than 40 mg/dL (2.22 mmol/L)
above fasting or a peak of 125 mg/dL (6.94 mmol/L).","Consumption of food or caloric beverages can significantly affect blood glucose levels. Postprandial glucose levels(PPG)
increase for approximately 30 minutes following a meal but then decrease and return to baseline (Razzak 2018).

Abnormally high fasting or non-fasting levels suggest impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, or diabetes.

Fasting blood giucose is measured after at least 8 hours since the last caloric intake, “early” non-fasting glucose is measured
within 3 hours of the last catoric intake, and “late” non-fasting is measured between 3 and 7.9 hours since the last caloric intake
(Wang 2022).

Ideally, glucose levels should return to premeal levels within 2 hours due to the action of insulin. A 2-hour PPG above 140
mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L) is highly suspect for diabetes and should be investigated further with an oral glucose tolerance test
(OGGT). A level exceeding 140 mg/dL after one hour may indicate gestational diabetes (Pagana 2022).

lsolated “excursions” of hyperglycemia increase cardiometabolic risk even when not associated with elevated fasting glucose
or HbAIC, suggesting that non-fasting glucose levels should be measured as part of a comprehensive assessment. Evaluating
non-fasting glucose may be preferred to HbAIC for identifying blood glucose dysregulation. A 2-hour PPG above 160 mg/dL
(8.89 mmol/L) was consistently observed in people with type 2 diabetes despite being considered in “good control,” i.¢., with
an HbAIC below 7% (Bonora 2006).

Non-fasting glucose provides better insight into overall glycemic control than fasting glucose when insulin resistance is a
factor. Fasting glucose may be maintained within the standard or even optimal range due to excess insulin secretion. However,
insulin resistance decreases glucose uptake by muscle tissue and increases blood glucose levels over time. This causes further
release of insulin until pancreatic insulin production progressively declines, leading to overt diabetes mellitus. Non-fasting
glucose should be monitored regularly, as postprandial hyperglycemia can occur years before fasting hyperglycemia (Turan
2019).

One group of NHANES subjects diagnosed with prediabetes or normal glucose tolerance based on fasting glucose and HbAIC
actually had type 2 diabetes with a 2-hour PPG of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or above. These individuals had significantly higher
rates of hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, microalbuminuria, and elevated ALT. However, a I-hour PPG of 155 mg/dL (8.6
mmol/L) or higher may be an early indicator of impaired beta cell function, reduced insulin sensitivity, and a significantly
increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Researchers suggest this 1-hour PPG cut-off should be used to identify prediabetes and
warrants further investigation, including evaluation of fructosamine and 1,5- anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) (Bergman 2018, 2020).
Implementation of a 1-hour PPG screen may not only identify those at risk of diabetes but may be a predictor of future
complications and mortality. This prudent approach can delay or prevent the onset of diabetes and improve the quality of life
for those at risk (Manco 2019). Even tighter glucose control may be needed to prevent progression to T2DM. A review of
NHANES data revealed that a single random blood glucose (RBG) of 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or above was more strongly
associated with undiagnosed diabetes than traditional risk factors, including hypertension, BMI, cardiovascular disease, or
family history of diabetes. Mean RBG was 89.9 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L) in those with no diabetes, 99.1 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) with
undiagnosed diabetes, and 156 mg/dL (8.7 mmol/L) in those with undiagnosed diabetes (Bowen 2015).

One study of 63 healthy male subjects observed a mean fasting blood glucose of 80.61 mg/dL (4.47 mmol/L) in those fasting
for 7-15 hours and a mean PPG of 85.53 mg/dL (4.75 mmol/L) taken within a range of 10 minutes to 6 hours after their last
meal. The highest PPG glucose observed was 117 mg/dL ( 6.49 mmol/L) in this healthy non-diabetic cohort (Razzak 2018).
Postprandial hyperglycemia is a risk factor for CVD and associated events, increased carotid intima-media thickness, carotid
artery stenosis, microvascular complications, cognitive dysfunction, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Research suggests that a
1% reduction in non-fasting glucose in those with an HbAIC of 6.5% or higher may reduce the relative risk of myocardial
infarction by 14% and the risk of microvascular complications by 37%. A 2-hour PPG of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater can
significantly increase cancer risk as well (Madsbad 2016).

A higher 1-2 hour PPG is a significant and stronger predictor of CVD events in subjects with type 2 diabetes. A community-
based observational study of non-fasting glucose and CVD risk in a cohort of 7.332 subjects found that higher PPG level was
an independent predictor of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. Non-fasting glucose levels were categorized as
non-diabetic, borderline diabetic, and diabetic, with levels of 113.5, 158.56, and 248.65 mg/dL (6.3, 8.8, and 13.8 mmol/L),
respectively, in men. Non-fasting glucose levels in women were 111.71, 156.76, and 263.06 mg/dL (6.2, 8.7, and 14.6 mmol/L),
respectively. The association between higher non-fasting glucose and cardiac risk remained unchanged when restricted to
within 3 hours of a meal (Imano 2012).

A large prospective study of 34,907 individuals found that cardiovascular mortality increased significantly with a late non-
fasting glucose of 105 mg/dL (5.83 mmol/L) or above, especiatly 15 mg/dL (6.38 mmol/L) or above. All-cause mortality began
to significantly increase with a late non-fasting glucose of 95 mg/dL (5.27 mmol/L) or above. Late PPG was defined as 3-7.9
hours after caloric intake (Wang 2022). Diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders often coexist. Thyroid hormones play an
essential role in glucose regulation, ultimately facilitated by the balance of the pancreas, brain, liver, intestine, adipose tissue,
and muscle tissue. Thyroid hormone influences glucose metabolism by affecting the pancreas, liver, Gl tract, skeletal muscles,
adipose tissue, and the central nervous system. It can increase post-meal glucose absorption by increasing G! motility and
promoting hepatic glucose release via increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Not surprisingly, hyperthyroidism is
associated with hyperglycemia and diabetes, though both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect insulin resistance
(Eom 2022).

Hyperthyroidism can contribute to impaired glucose tolerance via hepatic insulin resistance, while hypothyroidism is
associated with peripheral insulin resistance and a decreased rate of peripheral blood flow (Ha 2021). However, a complex
association exists between hypothyroidism and hypoglycemia, which can occur when skeletal muscle and adipose tissue
gluconeogenesis and hepatic glycogenolysis are impaired. This hypoglycemic effect can be exacerbated by adrenal
insufficiency (Eom 2022). Stress can increase blood glucose via the release of cortisol and catecholamines and should be
managed accordingly (Ranabir 2011). Once hormone imbalances have been addressed, non-fasting glucose levels can be
improved with lifestyle changes, increased physical activity, and nutrition intervention. Walking after meals and even short
intervals of activity throughout the day versus being sedentary improves PPG and insulin levels in those who are overweight or
obese (Dunstan 2012).

The type and quantity of macronutrients in a meal influence the timing and amount of glucose released into the bloodstream.
The order in which foods are consumed during a meal also affects PPG, as demonstrated in a small study of 11 individuals with
type 2 diabetes. When protein and vegetables were consumed first and carbohydrates last, PPG and insulin levels decreased
significantly. The 1-hour PPG was 199.4 mg/dL (11.07 mmol/L) when 68 grams of carbohydrate were consumed first versus
125.6 mg/dL (6.97 mmol/L) when the same amount of carbohydrate was consumed last. The 2-hour PPG was 169.2 mg/dL
(9.39 mmol/L) versus 140.8 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) consuming carbohydrates last (Shukla 2015). Soluble dietary fiber also helps
reduce the postprandial glucose response (Cassidy 2018).

Even meal timing may affect PPG. A meta-analysis aiso suggests that postprandial glucose response is lower for the same
meat during the day versus at night (Leung 2020).",65,140,3.61,7.77,75,125,4.16,6.94,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism can contribute to hypoglycemia when skeletal muscle and adipose tissue gluconeogenesis are impaired, or
adrenal insufficiency is present.

Insulin overdose or insulinoma

Excess insulin will drive blood glucose down to potentially dangerous levels due to its hypoglycemic effects. The insulin
hyperresponse seen early in type 2 diabetes progression can occur years before hyperglycemia occurs and should be
identified and addressed as early as possible.

Malabsorption

Blood glucose may be low following a meal if the carbohydrate is not adequately broken down and the glucose is absorbed
into the bloodstream.","Cardiovascular Disease

Elevated non-fasting glucose is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is predictive of coronary heart disease
development and myocardial infarction incidence. Cardiovascular risk increases significantly when glucose levels remain
elevated for 3 hours or more after a meal.

Diabetes Mellitus

Elevations in post-meal glucose levels may be an early sign of insulin resistance and decreasing beta-cell function. Identifying
elevated non-fasting glucose is a more sensitive and effective method of evaluating diabetes risk than fasting glucose or
hemoglobin AIC.

Hyperthyroidism

Thyroid hormone can increase blood glucose levels as it promotes GI motility, increases hepatic glucose production, and
contributes to hepatic insulin resistance.

Insulin Resistance

Insulin resistance causes less glucose to be taken up by muscle, leaving more glucose in circulation and prompting an increase
in insulin secretion. This vicious cycle continues until pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin production decline and overt
diabetes occurs.

Stress

Stress can increase blood glucose levels by activating the HPA axis and increasing cortisol and catecholamine levels.","• Pancreatic tumors

Glutathione - Total,"Glutathione is a compound produced in the body where it is a vital antioxidant and support molecule for the detoxification of
medications, toxins, and hormones. Glutathione is especially important for preventing acetaminophen toxicity. Glutathione also
helps rid cells of mercury.

Requirements are increased in the face of oxidative stress and an insufficiency of glutathione can lead to tissue damage and
reduced organ function.

Low levels of glutathione are associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders,
and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s.

Elevated levels of glutathione are uncommon but may be associated with chemotherapy resistance, lead poisoning, riboflavin
supplementation, hemolytic anemia, and elevated white blood cell counts. Blood transfusions may temporarily confound
glutathione resuits.","Glutathione is a tripeptide compound synthesized from the amino acids cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine. It is found in
abundance in the liver, kidney, muscle, red blood cells, and the brain.

It exists in a dynamic state between reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG), depending on
oxidative and inflammatory challenges. It is primarily present in the reduced state until oxidized. GSSG can be recycled back to
GSH by the enzyme gamma-glutamy! transferase (GGT), which maintains an inverse association with glutathione in the blood.
Significant decreases in total glutathione, due to decreased GSH, were seen in subjects with chronic conditions including
cancer, and cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal diseases.

Glutathione is considered a “master antioxidant,” playing a vital role in counteracting oxidative stress, protecting cells and
tissues, and supporting the detoxification of xenobiotics, medications, and hormones. It is crucial to phase || detoxification and
conjugation and assists in transporting mercury out of cells and out of the brain.

Glutathione serves a regulatory role in inflammation and is also a factor in the synthesis of proteins, leukotrienes,
prostaglandins, and DNA.

Plasma levels of glutathione will decrease in the face of increasing oxidative stress, aging, atherosclerosis, autoimmune
disorders, cancer, COVID-19, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, HIV, hypertension, infertility, inflammatory conditions, liver disease, lupus,
macular degeneration, mental health disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders,
Parkinson’s disease, preeclampsia, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and tuberculosis. A reduction in glutathione has been
associated with decreased dopamine production in neurons, possibly explaining its connection to Parkinson's disease.
Decreased levels of glutathione increase risk of oxidative stress, creating a vicious metabolic cycle. Levels of plasma
glutathione are positively correlated with other antioxidant markers such as vitamin C and total antioxidant capacity (TAC),
and negatively correlated with inflammatory and oxidative stress markers.

Glutathione levels were significantly depleted in cardiac patients, with levels 21-40% lower than healthy controls, depending on
the severity of cardiovascular disease categorized by the New York Heart Association (NYHA).

Decreased glutathione was also observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients Decreased glutathione in hospitalized COVID-19
patients was significantly associated with low TAC, increased oxidative status, and increased hospital stay, fever, and poorer
prognosis.

Dietary intake of antioxidants and glutathione precursors can support glutathione function and synthesis including alpha-lipoic
acid, brassica vegetables, curcumin, fruit/vegetable juices, glycine, green tea, N-acetylcysteine, omega-3 fatty acids, salmon,
and selenium.

Whey protein, found in cow’s milk, provides cysteine, and supplementation with whey can increase serum glutathione levels, as
can N-acetylcysteine and SAM-e. Consumption of almonds, non-alcoholic beer, and meditation have also been found to
increase glutathione.

Vitamin C intake below recommended levels correlates with increased oxidative stress, depletion of glutathione, impairment of
TAC, and elevation of oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitrites plus nitrates (NN).

Elevated levels of glutathione are uncommon but may be associated with chemotherapy resistance, lead poisoning, riboflavin
supplementation, hemolytic anemia, and elevated white blood cell counts. Blood transfusions may temporarily confound
glutathione results.",373,838,373,838,373,838,373,838,uM,uM,"Oxidative Stress and Cellular Damage

Glutathione is a primary antioxidant in the body. Reduced levels can lead to increased oxidative stress, damaging cells and
tissues. This can contribute to the progression of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer.

Compromised Immune Function

Glutathione plays a role in the immune system. Lower levels may impair the body's ability to fight infections and diseases
effectively.

Increased Inflammation

Reduced glutathione can lead to increased inflammation in the body, potentially worsening conditions like arthritis, asthma,
and other inflammatory diseases.

Increased Toxicity

Glutathione helps detoxify harmful substances in the liver. Low levels can lead to reduced capacity to detoxify, making the
body more susceptible to damage from toxins, drugs, and environmental pollutants.

Chronic Disease Progression

Low glutathione levels are often seen in chronic conditions like diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). It can exacerbate the severity and progression of these diseases.

Aging

Glutathione levels naturally decrease with age, which is associated with increased oxidative damage and may contribute to the
aging process and the development of age-related diseases.","Chemotherapy

High levels of glutathione have been linked to chemotherapy resistance in cancer treatments.

GlycA,"GlycA is a robust marker of systemic inflammation and an increasingly favorable biomarker for cardiovascular, metabolic, and
autoimmune disorders.

Elevated levels are associated with obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, lupus, psoriasis, arthritis, infection, immune activation, and other inflammatory conditions. Increasing levels can
mean an increasing severity of disease.

Levels above optimal warrant further investigation of the potential underlying causes of inflammation. Healthy lifestyle
changes and a nutrient-rich diet can help reduce elevated GlycA. Regular exercise can significantly reduce GlycA, especially
when combined with weight loss and improvements in diet.

Low levels of GlycA, in general, suggest low levels of systemic inflammation, except in sickle cell anemia, where levels can be
falsely decreased due to the destruction of red blood cells.","GlycA is a valuable biomarker for evaluating the underlying low-grade inflammation associated with insulin resistance,
metabolic syndrome, loss of beta cell function, and type 2 diabetes. Data from the large PREVEND cohort study found that
T2DM incidence was significantly associated with increased GlycA but not hs-CRP. Researchers note that after multiple
variable adjustments, the group with a significantly increased risk of T2DM had the highest GlycA and the lowest hs-CRP
(Connelly 2016).

GlycA (glycoprotein acetylation) measurement reflects glycosylation of acute phase proteins and is a robust marker of
systemic inflammation. It can be elevated in both acute and chronic inflammation and may be a more sensitive marker than C-
reactive protein.

It is becoming increasingly accepted as a biomarker for inflammatory and autoimmune disease as well as subclinical vascular
inflammation and cardiovascular risk.

GlycA is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery
calcium, cardiovascular disease, lower life expectancy, and autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and
psoriasis.

GlycA is found to be independently and inversely associated with cardiovascular health scores, global cognition, and memory.
Elevated GlycA is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, alcoholic liver disease, kidney disease, COPD, and
arthritis. In healthy individuals, it may predict mortality despite the lack of a formal diagnosis.

Elevated levels may reflect disease severity in conditions such as active vascular inflammation, immune activation, coronary
artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and psoriasis.

The relationship between glycoproteins and cancer, however, is complex. In some cancers, GlycA will be elevated, while in
others, there can be a downward trend. (Fuertes-Martin 2020).

HDL Cholesterol,"HDL functions to transport cholesterol from the peripheral tissues and vessel walls to the liver for processing and metabolism
into bile salts. It is known as “good cholesterol” because it is thought that this process of bringing cholesterol from the
peripheral tissue to the liver is protective against atherosclerosis. Decreased HDL is considered atherogenic, increased HDL is
considered protective.","The High Density Lipoprotein, also known as HDL, is composed of primarily phospholipid and apoproteins in its structure.
Lipoproteins are molecules that are composed of lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids) and proteins (apoprotein) in
various proportions.

Protective benefits of HDL may be due to its ability to influence the absorption and binding of LDL by smooth muscle and
other cells.

HDL must be viewed in relation to the total cholesterol and the LDL cholesterol levels. If the total cholesterol is low, a
decreased HDL level is not considered a cardiovascular risk. If the total cholesterol is elevated, HDL can be used as a strong
independent diagnostic indicator to determine the risk for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.

Both HDL and total cholesterol are independent risk factors.

It is quite common for one value to be normal and the other value to be elevated; a value that has a favorable effect does not
entirely cancel the unfavorable effect of the other.",45,100,1.16,2.59,55,93,1.42,2.4,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis

If HDL is less than 25% of the total cholesterol, then there is a strong clinical indication that hyperlipidemia is present. If the
serum triglycerides and LDL are also increased, hyperlipidemia is likely present and atherosclerosis should be ruled-out.
Diets high in refined carbohydrates

The Standard American Diet (SAD), which is very high in refined carbohydrates, can contribute to decreased HDL levels.
Metabolic Syndrome /hyperinsulinemia

If HDL levels are decreased, triglycerides are increased above the total cholesterol level with increased LDL cholesterol and
increased fasting blood glucose, then metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia are probable. Metabolic Syndrome can lead
to adrenal dysregulation, so adrenal hyperfunctioning should be ruled out.

Oxidative stress

Unoxidized cholesterol, including HDL cholesterol, acts as an antioxidant and a free radical scavenger in the body, so
decreased levels put the body at risk for developing oxidative stress, especially lipid peroxidation, and increases the chance of
free radical induced diseases.

Heavy metal/Chemical overload

patients with historically low HDL and total cholesterol levels may be more prone to heavy metal and chemical toxins due to
poor cell membrane integrity. This is irrespective of level of exposure, but related more to susceptibility of the individual
patient. This may also leave patients at an increased risk for developing neoplasm.

Fatty liver (early development) and Liver congestion

If HDL leveis are decreased, and LDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol levels are increased, then the early development of
fatty liver is possible. Liver congestion, due to the fatty liver, should be considered if total cholesterol is elevated, triglycerides
are increased, and the ALT is decreased. Fatty liver is caused by obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, prescription drugs
(e.g. steroids), iron overload, solvent exposure, and rapid weight loss. Fatty changes to the liver tissue can impair the liver’s
detoxification ability. The degree of fatty liver changes is directly related to the amount of obesity. Fatty tiver and liver
congestion increases the risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, Metabolic Syndrome, and type Il diabetes mellitus.

Hyperthyroidism

The increased metabolic activity found in hyperthyroidism can lead to decreased HDL levels. The body preferentially uses fatty
acids, which are transported via lipoproteins, for energy in this heightened metabolic state.

Lack of exercise/ sedentary lifestyle

A sedentary lifestyle has been shown to decrease HDL levels. Increasing cardiovascular and resistance exercise is a very good
way to elevate HDL levels.","Autoimmune processes

lf HDL cholesterol is increased, and triglycerides are decreased with low or normal cholesterol, then some kind of autoimmune
process in the body is possible. The problem may be inflammatory or destructive in nature. Consider further testing to rule-out
tissue inflammation or destruction (C-reactive protein, ANA, rheumatoid factor etc.). If tissue destruction is present, LDH,
Alpha 1 or Alpha 2 globulin (seen with serum protein electrophoresis) will frequently be increased. This may also be a sign of
endocrine dysfunction due to endocrine hypo or hyper function. Consider further endocrine testing to locate the cause of the
disturbance. Before running these tests ask the patient about historical HDL levels, whether they have a genetic predisposition
i.e. family history, or whether they are exercising heavily. These factors may contribute to significantly increased HDL levels ina
healthy patient.","• Obesity

If there is a decreased HCT with a decreased HGB, RBC, and uric acid and an increased MCH, MCV, RDW, LDH (especially the
LDH-1 isoenzyme fraction) and serum iron, then B12/folic acid anemia is probable. Often you will see decreased WBC and
neutrophils and an increased LDH in megaloblastic anemia. Homocysteine often. Check with methylmalonic acid. The presence
of hypersegmented neutrophils has been reported to be more sensitive and reliable than an elevated MCV in detecting
megaloblastic anemia and is not affected by coexisting iron deficiency. If MCV is oral supplementation may be ineffective. B12

If there is decreased HCT with a decreased HGB and RBCs, and low high MCV, an increased to normal MCH, and an increased
or decreased hair copper, then copper anemia is possible. Check serum or WBC copper.

Internal bleeding

An unrecognized internal bleed can cause a gradual decrease in hematocrit due to the loss of blood. Internal bleeding is a
serious condition and should be referred to a specialist qualified to diagnose and treat this condition.

Hemoglobin A1C,"The Hemoglobin AIC test measures the amount of glucose that combines with hemoglobin to form glycohemogiobin during
the normal lifespan of a red blood cell, which is about 120 days. The amount of glycohemoglobin formed is in direct proportion
to the amount of glucose present in the bloodstream during the 120-day red blood cell lifespan. In the presence of high blood
glucose levels (hyperglycemia) the amount of hemoglobin that is glycosylated to form glycohemoglobin increases and the
hemoglobin AIC level will be high. Hemoglobin AIC is used primarily to monitor long-term blood glucose control and to help
determine therapeutic options for treatment and management. Studies have shown that the closer to normal the
hemoglobin AIC levels are kept, the less likely those patients are to develop the long-term complications of diabetes.","The hemoglobin AIC test reflects the amount of non-enzymatic glycosylation that occurs on a minor sub-type of
hemoglobin called AIC. it shows the average levels of blood glucose in a 2-3 month period before the test. The process of
glycosylation is irreversible. In short, the longer blood glucose levels remain high, and the greater the amount of glucose in the
blood, the more the glucose will attach to the red blood cells.

This test is a poor screening test for diabetes. An oral glucose tolerance test with or without insulin is the preferred screening
test for diabetes.

Note: Different labs may use different tests to determine glycosylated hemoglobin. The most common and most specific test
measures hemoglobin AIC levels. Other tests may have different values. Check with your lab to determine what type of test
they are doing for glycosylated hemoglobin and what their values are.",0,5.70%,0,5.70%,4.60%,5.30%,4.60%,5.30%,,,"Hypoglycemia
A low hemoglobin AIC may be caused by an inability to maintain adequate long-term levels of glucose. A decreased fasting
blood glucose along with a decreased LDH is a common finding in reactive hypoglycemia. LDH is an important enzyme for
pyruvate metabolism in glycolysis and is associated with pancreatic function and glucose metabolism.","Diabetes mellitus

This test is a measurement of long-term blood glucose control and management. Values will be increased in patients with
poorly controlled diabetes. It is important to remember that a patient who has recently made the changes to control their
short-term blood glucose levels may still show elevated levels of glycosylated hemoglobin.

Insulin resistance (early stage) and glucose intolerance

An increased hemoglobin AIC above the optimal range is a sign that this individual is not controlling their long-term glucose
levels very well. They are possibly in the insulin-resistant phase, also known as a pre-diabetic state. Research has shown that
individuals progress through several stages of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance before becoming a classic type Il

"Histamine, Plasma","Histamine is a bioactive compound involved in immune inflammatory reactions, allergies, vasoactivation, gastric acid secretion,
and blood cell formation. High levels of histamine can cause classic symptoms such as sneezing, congestion, rash, bloating,
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Histamine intolerance is associated with Gi disorders,
including IBD, IBS, celiac disease, and reduced production or activity of diamine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down
intestinal histamine. A low histamine level may not be considered clinically relevant.","Histamine, a bioactive amine, is synthesized from the amino acid L-histidine using the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate form of vitamin
B6 as a cofactor. Histamine is found in most tissues, including gastric mucosa, parietal cells, and neurons, but is found in the
highest concentrations in mast cells, basophils, and the lungs. Macrophages, neutrophils, platelets, and dendritic cells can
produce large amounts of histamine, but only mast cells and basophils store significant amounts. Most histamine is broken
down by histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT) (50-80%) and diamine oxide (DAO) (15-30%). Histamine has potent
vasoactive activity, plays a role in immunoregulation and the inflammatory response, and is a mediator of allergic reactions,
autoimmune conditions, gastric acid secretion, and new blood cell formation in the bone marrow, e.g., RBCs, WBCs, and
platelets. It is also a significant activator of neutrophils and eosinophils (Patel 2023).

Mast cell histamine release is associated with celiac disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and mast cell activation syndrome
(MCAS). Histamine intolerance (HIT), often related to insufficient DAO, was found in 55% of celiac disease subjects who did not
respond to a gluten-free diet (Schnedl 2021).

Histamine is also produced by bacterial fermentation and, therefore, can be found in fermented foods and even produced by
GI bacteria. An insufficiency of gastrointestinal DAO, the enzyme responsible for breaking down ingested or microbiota-
generated histamine, can lead to histamine intolerance. HIT is associated with bloating, postprandial vertigo, headache,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. A serum DAO below 10 U/mL may be related to HIT. A low-histamine diet and DAO
supplementation may help relieve HIT symptoms (Schnedl 2021).

DAO insufficiency may be temporary if caused by substances that inhibit it, including alcohol; competing bioactive amines
such as putrescine and cadaverine found in citrus, mushrooms, soybeans, nuts, and bananas; and certain medications,
including chloroquine, clavulanic acid, verapamil, clonidine, and metoclopramide. Other amine-containing foods, including
papaya, kiwi, strawberries, plums, and pineapples, may trigger histamine release, contributing to histamine intolerance
(Comas-Basté 2020).

Histamine-rich foods include fish, seafood, fermented or aged foods (e.g., cheese, pickles, and sausage), and certain
vegetables, including spinach, eggplant, and tomato. These foods should be limited in HIT. Supplementing with DAO enzyme
cofactors vitamin C, copper, and vitamin B6 may be a beneficial adjunctive therapy (Smolinska 2022).
Symptoms begin to occur as histamine accumulates in the blood, often involving three or more organs, and average symptoms
11 per patient. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most frequent and severe and include postprandial fullness, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, and constipation, followed by nervous system and cardiovascular symptoms, including dizziness, headache, and
palpitations. Respiratory and dermatological symptoms can occur as well (Comas-Basté 2020).
Additional symptoms of histamine intolerance include nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinitis, dyspnea, decreased muscle tone,
itchy skin, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and collapse. Histamine can increase the synthesis and release of catecholamines,
causing increased blood pressure, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, and sleep disturbance. Histamine produced by Gl
bacteria can pass through into the plasma and cause adverse reactions. Histamine-secreting bacteria include Staphylococcus,
Proteus, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis (Smolinska 2022).
The activation of four types of histamine receptors determines symptomatology (Patel 2023):
H1 receptors
e Found throughout the body, including blood vessels, neurons, and airway smooth muscles
e Regulate sleep-wake cycles, thermal regulation, food intake, emotions/aggressive behavior, memory, learning, and
locomotion
e Activation of H1 receptors causes allergic/anaphylactic reactions, including vasodilation, vascular permeability,
hypotension, tachycardia, flushing. pruritus, inflammation, mucosal edema, smooth muscle spasm, and
bronchoconstriction
H2 receptors
e Found mostly in gastric mucosa parietal cells, smooth muscle cells, and the heart

e Activation of H2 receptors facilitates gastric acid secretion, vascular permeability, flushing, hypotension, headaches,
tachycardia, and bronchoconstrictionH2 antagonists are used to treat and prevent duodenal ulcers

H3 receptors

e Essential modulators of histamine release from mast cells and cerebral neurons

e Found primarily in histaminergic neurons responsible for moderating central nervous system histamine, dopamine,

serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine release

H4 receptors

e Found in bone marrow and peripheral hematopoietic cells and considered immune system histamine receptors

e Play a role in chemotaxis and differentiation of myeloblasts and promyeloblasts.
Histamine can be measured in whole blood or in plasma. Early research in 12 subjects used histamine infusion to identify the
level at which plasma histamine was associated with various symptoms. A level of 0.62 ng/mL (5.58 nmol/L) was related to
basal histamine, an increase to 1.6 ng/mL (14.49 nmol/L) was associated with a 30% increase in heart rate; 2.39 ng/mL (21.50
nmol/L) was associated with significant flushing and headache; and 2.45 ng/mL (22.04 nmol/L) was associated with a 30%
increase in pulse pressure. Antihistamine therapy increased the threshold at which the symptoms occurred. Dose-related
symptoms included increased pulse rate, decreased diastolic blood pressure, cutaneous flushing, and pulsatile headache
(Kaliner 1982). Migraine sufferers can have significantly elevated plasma histamine during and in between migraine attacks
(Haimart 1987).
A review of data from 55 BioCenter Laboratory patients found the highest blood histamine in those with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) and bipolar, organic brain syndrome. Researchers note that histamine itself functions as a neurotransmitter and
elevated levels may be associated with headaches, personality disorders, and even schizophrenia (Jackson 1998).

Elevated histamine is seen in at least 50% of acute allergic reactions presenting to the emergency department. Plasma
histamine levels above 1.11 ng/mL (10 nmol/L) correlate better with acute allergic reactions than tryptase levels. Clinical signs
associated with elevated histamine include urticaria, extensive erythema, wheezing, and abdominal symptoms, while only
urticaria was related to elevated tryptase above 15 ng/mL. The severity of urticaria appears to be the best predictor of plasma
histamine. An elevation in histamine but not in tryptase suggests the involvement of basophils, which produce much less
tryptase than mast cells do. Gastrointestinal symptoms are likely to be associated with elevated histamine and food allergies
(Lin 2000).

Vitamin C breaks down the imidazole ring of histamine and can reduce elevated histamine in the blood. A dose of 2,000 mg of
vitamin C can reduce plasma histamine by 40% (Ramanujan 2024). Whole blood histamine increases exponentially as plasma
vitamin C levels fall below 1 mg/dL (56.78 umol/L, with a highly significant increase in histamine when plasma vitamin C falls
below 0.7 mg/dL (39.75 umol/L) (Clemetson 1980).

Histamine intolerance may be associated with medication sensitivity. In a study of 34 subjects, plasma histamine, but not
whole blood histamine, was significantly higher in those reporting hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Histamine was also significantly higher in those reporting sensitivity to COX-1 versus COX-2
selective inhibitors (Kakolyri 2020).",0,1.8,0,16.19,0,1,0,9,ng/mL,nmol/L,"Low Risk of Histamine Intolerance
A low histamine level suggests the absence of histamine intolerance and may not be considered clinically relevant.","Allergy

Histamine is a significant mediator of allergic reactions associated with classic allergy symptoms, including sneezing,
congestion, runny nose, skin rash, hives, and local inflammation. It can also cause gastrointestinal distress, diarrhea, headaches,
migraines, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Histamine can also activate neutrophils and eosinophils, promoting immune
involvement.

DAO Insufficiency

Diamine oxidase (DAO) is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down ingested and intestinal histamine, including that
produced by gastrointestinal bacteria. DAO insufficiency may be due to genetic factors, gastrointestinal inflammation, or
intake of alcohol or medications that interfere with DAO metabolism.

Gastrointestinal Disorders

Gastrointestinal disorders that can interfere with histamine breakdown and increase levels include inflammatory bowel disease,
irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, gastroenteritis, and overgrowth of Gi bacteria that produce histamine.

Foods High in Histamine

Many fermented foods contain high amounts of histamine due to microbial conversion of histidine to histamine during
fermentation. Histamine may also be present in other, non-fermented foods. High-histamine foods include aged cheese,
sausage, fish, red wine, and certain vegetables, including spinach, eggplant, and tomato. Symptoms may not be apparent
unless histamine ingestion is excessive or if the activity of DAO, the enzyme that breaks down intestinal histamine, is disrupted.
Histamine Intolerance or Intoxication

Histamine intolerance (HIT) occurs when histamine accumulation is greater than the body's ability to break it down. HIT is
associated with ingesting histamine from foods or the accumulation of histamine produced by gastrointestinal bacteria. HIT is
most often due to a deficiency or inhibition of diamine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down histamine in the intestine.
Histamine intoxication may occur when excessive histamine is consumed in foods, especially spoiled fish, a condition
previously called scombroid poisoning.

Common symptoms of excess histamine include gastrointestinal distress, changes in bowel habits, skin rash, hives, headache,
dizziness, and low blood pressure.

"Histamine, Whole Blood","Histamine is a bioactive compound involved in immune inflammatory reactions, allergies, vasoactivation, gastric acid secretion,
and blood cell formation. High levels of histamine can cause classic symptoms such as sneezing, congestion, rash, bloating,
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Histamine intolerance is associated with Gi disorders,
including IBD, IBS, celiac disease, and reduced production or activity of diamine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down
intestinal histamine. A low histamine level may not be considered clinically relevant.","Histamine, a bioactive amine, is synthesized from the amino acid L-histidine using the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate form of vitamin
B6 as a cofactor. Histamine is found in most tissues, including gastric mucosa, parietal cells, and neurons, but is found in the
highest concentrations in mast cells, basophils, and the lungs. Macrophages, neutrophils, platelets, and dendritic cells can
produce large amounts of histamine, but only mast cells and basophils store significant amounts. Most histamine is broken
down by histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT) (50-80%) and diamine oxide (DAO) (15-30%). Histamine has potent
vasoactive activity, plays a role in immunoregulation and the inflammatory response, and is a mediator of allergic reactions,
autoimmune conditions, gastric acid secretion, and new blood cell formation in the bone marrow, e.g., RBCs, WBCs, and
platelets. It is also a significant activator of neutrophils and eosinophils (Patel 2023).

Mast cell histamine release is associated with celiac disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and mast cell activation syndrome
(MCAS). Histamine intolerance (HIT), often related to insufficient DAO, was found in 55% of celiac disease subjects who did not
respond to a gluten-free diet (Schnedl 2021).

Histamine is also produced by bacterial fermentation and, therefore, can be found in fermented foods and even produced by
GI bacteria. An insufficiency of gastrointestinal DAO, the enzyme responsible for breaking down ingested or microbiota-
generated histamine, can lead to histamine intolerance. HIT is associated with bloating, postprandial vertigo, headache,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. A serum DAO below 10 U/mL may be related to HIT. A low-histamine diet and DAO
supplementation may help relieve HIT symptoms (Schnedl 2021).

DAO insufficiency may be temporary if caused by substances that inhibit it, including alcohol; competing bioactive amines
such as putrescine and cadaverine found in citrus, mushrooms, soybeans, nuts, and bananas; and certain medications,
including chloroquine, clavulanic acid, verapamil, clonidine, and metoclopramide. Other amine-containing foods, including
papaya, kiwi, strawberries, plums, and pineapples, may trigger histamine release, contributing to histamine intolerance
(Comas-Basté 2020).

Histamine-rich foods include fish, seafood, fermented or aged foods (e.g., cheese, pickles, and sausage), and certain
vegetables, including spinach, eggplant, and tomato. These foods should be limited in HIT. Supplementing with DAO enzyme
cofactors vitamin C, copper, and vitamin B6 may be a beneficial adjunctive therapy (Smolinska 2022).
Symptoms begin to occur as histamine accumulates in the blood, often involving three or more organs, and average symptoms
11 per patient. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most frequent and severe and include postprandial fullness, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, and constipation, followed by nervous system and cardiovascular symptoms, including dizziness, headache, and
palpitations. Respiratory and dermatological symptoms can occur as well (Comas-Basté 2020).
Additional symptoms of histamine intolerance include nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinitis, dyspnea, decreased muscle tone,
itchy skin, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and collapse. Histamine can increase the synthesis and release of catecholamines,
causing increased blood pressure, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, and sleep disturbance. Histamine produced by Gl
bacteria can pass through into the plasma and cause adverse reactions. Histamine-secreting bacteria include Staphylococcus,
Proteus, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis (Smolinska 2022).
The activation of four types of histamine receptors determines symptomatology (Patel 2023):
H1 receptors
e Found throughout the body, including blood vessels, neurons, and airway smooth muscles
e Regulate sleep-wake cycles, thermal regulation, food intake, emotions/aggressive behavior, memory, learning, and
locomotion
e Activation of H1 receptors causes allergic/anaphylactic reactions, including vasodilation, vascular permeability,
hypotension, tachycardia, flushing, pruritus, inflammation, mucosal edema, smooth muscle spasm, and
bronchoconstriction
H2 receptors
e Found mostly in gastric mucosa parietal cells, smooth muscle cells, and the heart

e Activation of H2 receptors facilitates gastric acid secretion, vascular permeability, flushing, hypotension, headaches,
tachycardia, and bronchoconstrictionH2 antagonists are used to treat and prevent duodenal ulcers

H3 receptors

e Essential modulators of histamine release from mast cells and cerebral neurons

e Found primarily in histaminergic neurons responsible for moderating central nervous system histamine, dopamine,

serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine release

H4 receptors

e Found in bone marrow and peripheral hematopoietic cells and considered immune system histamine receptors

e Play a role in chemotaxis and differentiation of myeloblasts and promyeloblasts.
Histamine can be measured in whole blood or in plasma. Early research in 12 subjects used histamine infusion to identify the
level at which plasma histamine was associated with various symptoms. A level of 0.62 ng/mL (5.58 nmol/L) was related to
basal histamine, an increase to 1.6 ng/mL (14.49 nmol/L) was associated with a 30% increase in heart rate; 2.39 ng/mL (21.50
nmol/L) was associated with significant flushing and headache; and 2.45 ng/mL (22.04 nmol/L) was associated with a 30%
increase in pulse pressure. Antihistamine therapy increased the threshold at which the symptoms occurred. Dose-related
symptoms included increased pulse rate, decreased diastolic blood pressure, cutaneous flushing, and pulsatile headache
(Kaliner 1982). Migraine sufferers can have significantly elevated plasma histamine during and in between migraine attacks
(Haimart 1987).
A review of data from 55 BioCenter Laboratory patients found the highest blood histamine in those with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) and bipolar, organic brain syndrome. Researchers note that histamine itself functions as a neurotransmitter and
elevated levels may be associated with headaches, personality disorders, and even schizophrenia (Jackson 1998).

HOMA2-%B,"The HOMA2 (Homeostasis Model Assessment) calculator is a tool used to express the degree of insulin sensitivity and insulin
resistance. HOMA2-%B helps estimate the beta-cell function of the pancreas.

The beta cells of the pancreatic islets are responsible for the production and secretion of insulin.

Beta cells have a small capacity to store insulin, and the stored insulin is secreted immediately upon elevation of blood glucose
levels, causing a resultant short-term increase in blood insulin levels. Reduced insulin release in this initial phase is the earliest
known detectable indicator of beta-cell dysfunction and is an independent predictor of T2DM.

Traditionally, the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is used to assess for diabetes, insulin resistance, and impaired beta-cell function,
however, it does not have the capacity to distinguish between peripheral insulin resistance and a reduced capacity of the
pancreatic beta-cell to produce insulin. HOMA2 can therefore be used to provide a more detailed picture of physiologic
changes, and treatment can be directed accordingly.","In the initial stages of insulin resistance, where an increased level of insulin is required to respond to blood glucose levels, the
HOMA2-%B measurement will increase, representing the increased activity of the beta cells, and the increased insulin being
secreted. Elevated HOMA2-%B measurements in addition to elevated HOMA2-IR measurements are indicative of pre-diabetes
and dietary and lifestyle intervention should be initiated.

After prolonged, untreated insulin resistance and overactivity of beta cells, the beta cells will lose their capacity to maintain an
increased activity level, beta-cell function and insulin production will decline, and this will be expressed by a decrease in the
HOMA2-%B measurement. A decreasing HOMA2-%B measurement (a decline of beta-cell function and insulin secretion), in

Insulin sensitivity is a term used to indicate the responsiveness of the peripheral tissue cells to insulin, and their resultant
capacity to uptake glucose out of the bloodstream. In patients with chronically elevated serum insulin levels, peripheral tissue
cells will become less sensitive to insulin, and will therefore require more insulin to be secreted by the pancreatic beta cells in

In patients with insulin resistance, the pancreatic beta-cells respond by secreting increasing amounts of insulin, in an effort to
return serum blood glucose levels back to normal. Chronic insulin resistance is typically seen as a component of pre-diabetes,

Homocysteine,"Homocysteine is a molecule formed from the incomplete metabolism of the amino acid methionine. Deficiencies in Vitamins
B6, B12, and folate cause methionine to be converted into homocysteine. Homocysteine increases the risk of cardiovascular
disease by causing damage to the endothelial lining of the arteries, especially in the heart. increased levels of homocysteine
are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, as well as cancer, depression, and inflammatory
bowel disease. Decreased levels of homocysteine are associated with a decrease in the body's detoxification capacity and an
increased risk of oxidative stress.","Deficiencies in Vitamins B6, B12 and folate cause methionine to be converted into homocysteine. Homocysteine increases the
risk of cardiovascular disease by causing damage to the endothelial lining of the arteries, especially in the heart. Homocysteine
was first theorized to cause vascular disease when autopsy results of young people revealed atherosclerotic plaque in those
with very high homocysteine levels. Over a 37-year period, doctors uncovered startling evidence linking elevated
homocysteine to increased risks of heart attack, stroke, and other disorders in aging adults.

How does homocysteine cause such damage?

Homocysteine, along with a number of other factors, causes endothelial dysfunction, which is basically a term that describes
the functional and structural damage that occurs to the inner lining of the arteries. This damage is the first step on the road to
full-blown atherosclerosis, which is the cause of most heart attacks and strokes.

The endothelium protects the smooth muscle in the middle of the artery from toxic metabolites in the blood that can cause
damage to the smooth muscle cells. When toxic metabolites attack the smooth muscle cells, the process of atherosclerosis is
initiated.

Low Homocysteine

Under normal circumstances, homocysteine can be recycled back into methionine via transmethylation (B12/folate dependent)
or converted to cysteine via transsulfuration (B6 dependent). Cysteine can then be converted into reduced glutathione, a key
factor in detoxification and antioxidant mechanisms in the body. Cysteine also yields taurine and sulfate so its production is
important to several metabolic pathways including detoxification.

A low or suboptimal level of homocysteine may contribute to disease due to related insufficiency of cysteine, glutathione,
taurine, or sulfate. Cysteine is the rate-limiting amino acid for glutathione synthesis so its depletion will impair phase 2
detoxification and reduce an individual's ability to counteract oxidative stress.

Research suggests that homocysteine levels below 4 umol/L are inadequate to meet physiological requirements for
homocysteine and its related sulfur compounds. Conversely, homocysteine levels above 10 umol/L reflect impaired
homocysteine metabolism and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic disorders. Therefore, clinicians
recommend an optimal blood homocysteine level of 5-7.2 umol/L.",0,10.3,0,10.3,5,7.2,5,7.2,umol/L,umol/L,"Detoxification impairment

Inadequate homocysteine can lead to a depletion of cysteine and its related compounds taurine, sulfate, and glutathione, all of
which participate in phase 2 detoxification.

Oxidative stress

Depletion of glutathione associated with low levels of homocysteine can reduce an individual's ability to counteract oxidative
stress. Glutathione peroxidase is the main enzyme responsible for glutathione’s antioxidant activity.
Malnutrition-inflammation-cachexia syndrome

Hypohomocysteinemia is associated with a condition known as malnutrition-inflammation-cachexia syndrome in chronic
kidney disease patients. Ironically low homocysteine levels may cause a worsening of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in
these patients. Increasing homocysteine to optimal levels improves survival.

Peripheral neuropathy

Low homocysteine is strongly associated with peripheral neuropathy. A retrospective review of 37,442 patients revealed that
41% of patients who had homocysteine levels below 6 umol/L had idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.","Increased Risk for Cardiovascular Disease
Hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition of increased homocysteine levels, is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease,
arterial disease, stroke, and venous thrombosis. Homocysteine levels are affected by nutritional and genetic factors. Consider
genetic testing for MTHFR gene mutations with elevated levels of homocysteine.

"IgA, Serum","Immunoglobulin A (igA) is a primary antibody located in mucosal linings—such as those in the gastrointestinal (GI) and
respiratory tracts—where it acts as a critical defense against pathogens. IgA is also present in other secretions, including saliva,
tears, and breast milk. In serum, IgA represents about 10-15% of total immunoglobulins, but its primary importance lies in
safeguarding mucosal surfaces, making it a key component of mucosal immunity. Variations in serum IgA can reflect changes
in mucosal immune function, metabolic status, and overall inflammatory burden.","A low IgA level (often termed selective IgA deficiency when other immunoglobulins remain normal) is one of the most
common primary immunodeficiencies. Individuals with low IgA may experience recurrent sinus, lung, or GI infections due to
reduced mucosal defense, as well as an increased incidence of altergic and autoimmune disorders. While many with selective
IgA deficiency remain asymptomatic, clinicians should investigate for underiying triggers, carefully monitor for recurrent
infections, and consider evaluating other immune markers (like IgG subclasses) to capture a broader picture of immune
competence.

A high IgA level typically reflects ongoing stimulation of the mucosal immune system or chronic inflammatory states. Common
causes include persistent infections, autoimmune conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflarsmatory bowel disease), obesity,
and metabolic syndrome. Obesity-driven subclinical inflammation can boost igA production, whereas Gl infections may
directly stimulate mucosal immunity. When serum IgA is significantly elevated, especially as a monoclonal spike, further
evaluation via immunofixation electrophoresis is warranted to exclude plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma or
other monoclonal gammopathies.

Clinicians frequently measure serum IgA alongside IgG and IgM to differentiate selective IgA deficiency from more global
immune impairments. In patients presenting with suspected GI or respiratory pathology, IgA findings may guide decisions on
further diagnostic imaging, endoscopy, or serologic tests for autoimmune disease. Monitoring IgA levels over time can also
help assess disease progression in inflammatory states or the efficacy of therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing mucosal
inflammation.",47,310,0.47,3.1,81,310,0.81,3.1,mg/dL,g/L,"Selective IgA Deficiency

IGF - 1,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), also known as somatomedin C, is a hormone that works with growth hormone to promote
the normal development of bone, tissue, and lean muscle mass. Production of IGF-1 is stimulated by growth hormone from the
pituitary gland. An elevation in IGF-1 can be associated with increased circulating insulin levels related to obesity and excess
high simple sugar intake. A decrease in |IGF-1 levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, a decrease in bone density,
inflammation, a decrease in lean body mass, lipid abnormalities, and adults with abnormally low IGF-1 may present with fatigue
and reduced tolerance to exercise.","Nutrient intake and insulin levels regulate IGF-1 and levels will decrease with reduced intake of calories, protein, or
carbohydrate.

Growth hormone (produced in the pituitary gland), stimulates the production of IGF-1 in the liver, skeletal muscle, and other
metabolically active tissues. IGF-1 is then responsible for mediating many actions of growth hormone. Production of IGF-1 can
also be stimulated by elevated insulin levels.

Measurement of IGF-1] helps assess decreased bone density, reduced muscle strength, and increased blood lipids in adults
(suggestive of insufficient growth hormone and IGF-1). It is also used to assess gigantism or acromegaly (suggestive of excess
growth hormone and |IGF-1), or delayed growth in children (suggestive of inadequate growth hormone and IGF-1). in general,
levels of IGF-1 rise during childhood, peak at puberty, and then decline in adulthood.

IGF-1 levels are stable throughout the day, making it an important indicator for growth hormone which fluctuates throughout
the day.",53,331,6.94,43.36,92,300,12.05,39.3,ng/mL,nmol/L,"Metabolic syndrome

Low levels of IGF-1 have been associated with metabolic syndrome and its associated metabolic disturbances including an
impaired lipid profile, insulin resistance, elevated glucose, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. In obese patients meeting
metabolic syndrome criteria, those with a low normal IGF-] had worse cardiovascular outcomes than those with mid to high
normal IGF-1.

Bone density decrease

Decreased production of IGF-1 can lead to decreased bone density.

Lean body mass decrease

Insufficiency IGF-t can contribute to decreased lean body mass and decreased muscle strength.

Lipid level abnormalities

IGF-1 is integral to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and its insufficiency can contribute to increased blood lipid levets.
Fatigue, reduced tolerance to exercise

Adults with abnormally low IGF-1 may present with fatigue and reduced tolerance to exercise.

Dementia, Alzheimer’s disease

Low levels of |GF-1 were associated with the development of dementia, especially Alzheimer’s. In those studied who did not
develop dementia, higher levels of IGF-1 correlated with greater total brain volume.

Growth hormone resistance

A number of conditions can contribute to a lack of sensitivity to growth hormone signaling... . these include chronic disease,
malnutrition, hypothyroidism, sex hormone deficiency, or genetic (rare) causes.

Liver disease

Levels of IGF-1 were found to be significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Pituitary gland dysfunction

Dysfunction or damage to the pituitary gland can result in a decreased production of growth hormone which in turn reduces
the production of IGF-1.

Short stature

Insufficient IGF-1 in childhood can inhibit bone growth and overall development leading to short stature.","Abnormal growth

Excess IGF-] and growth hormone cause an abnormal increase in the growth of the skeleton, causing gigantism or acromegaly.
Complications of these conditions include enlarged organs (including the heart), type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis,
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased lifespan.

Cancer risk increase

Insulin-like growth factor-1 may promote prostate, breast, lung, and colon cancer. It may be instrumental in stimulating cancer
cell growth and inhibiting their death.

Insulin resistance, obesity, simple carbohydrate intake

An elevation in IGF-1 can be associated with increased circulating insulin levels related to obesity and excess high simple sugar
intake.

Pituitary gland tumor

A pituitary tumor (usually benign) is the most common cause of elevated growth hormone which in turn increases IGF-1
production. If levels of IGF-1 are significantly elevated then a pituitary hormone is strongly suspected. !f levels are slightly
elevated then a glucose suppression test can help confirm the presence of a growth hormone-producing pituitary tumor. Since
an excess intake of sugar normally causes a drop in growth hormone, a sustained elevation of growth hormone indicates a
pituitary tumor.",,,,,,,
"IgG, Serum","Immunoglobulin G (igG) constitutes approximately 75-80% of the total immunoglobulins in serum. It plays a key role in
protecting the body against bacterial and viral infections by recognizing antigens and facilitating opsonization. Through
immunological memory, lgG provides durable and often lifelong immunity following exposure to a pathogen or vaccination.
IgG can cross the placenta, offering passive immunity to newborns. Variations in IgG levels can reflect the body’s response to
infection, inflammation, or immune dysregulation.","Low IgG (hypogammaglobulinemia) often presents with recurrent infections, particularly involving the sinopulmonary tract. It
can be either a primary immunodeficiency (e.g., common variable immunodeficiency) or secondary to external factors such as
immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., steroids), chronic illness, or malnutrition. Some patients may be asymptomatic, but
identifying low igG early can help prevent complications, such as chronic lung damage from repeated infections. Measuring
IgG subclasses (IgGl, |gG2, IgG3, IgG4) can provide deeper insight into the specific arm of the immune system that’s
compromised.

High IgG typically indicates ongoing or past antigenic stimulation. Chronic infections—like hepatitis, HIV, or persistent bacterial
pathogens—can drive polyclonal lgG elevation, while autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis) may also upregulate IgG production. In some cases, a monoctonal expansion of IgG points to plasma cell disorders
such as multiple myeloma or Waldenstré6m macroglobulinemia. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation help
distinguish benign polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia from monoclonal gammopathies, guiding further diagnostic steps like
bone marrow biopsy and imaging if indicated.

Assessing IgG levels over time can aid clinicians in monitoring disease progression, therapeutic efficacy, or early relapse
detection—particularly in hematologic malignancies or chronic infections. Combined with IgA, IgM, and other immune markers,
IgG measurements form a cornerstone of immunologic evaluation, helping distinguish between congenital and acquired
causes of immune dysfunction.",600,1640,6,16.4,700,1600,7,16,mg/dL,g/L,"Immunodeficiencies

"IgM, Serum","Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the largest antibody molecule and typically represents the body's first tine of antibody-mediated
defense against new or re-exposed antigens. It is primarily produced by B lymphocytes in the early stages of an immune
response before class switching leads to the production of IgG, IgA, or IgE. Despite accounting for a smaller proportion of
total serum immunoglobulins compared to IgG, IgM plays a pivotal role in neutralizing pathogens, activating the complement
system, and facilitating opsonization.","A low IgM level may point toward an immunodeficiency, whether congenital or acquired. Selective IgM deficiency, though rare,
can present with recurrent infections, particularly in respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. More commonly, low gM occurs as
part of broader immune dysregulation—such as in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)—or secondary to
immunosuppressive medications, chronic illness, or matnutrition. Clinically, these patients can experience repeated infections,
underscoring the importance of evaluating total immunoglobulin levels (IgG, igA, IgM) and assessing specific antibody
responses to vaccines for a comprehensive view of immune function.

A high IgM level is frequently associated with acute-phase immune reactions, reflecting an active or recent infection. Over
time, an effective immune response will typically switch to producing higher levels of IgG while IgM declines. However, some
autoimmune conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and chronic infections can result in persistently elevated IgM. Monoclonal
gammopathies—most notably Waldenstr6m macroglobulinemia—may manifest as a marked IgM spike on serum protein
electrophoresis. Clinicians should correlate elevated IgM with symptoms, imaging, and other laboratory studies, such as
complete blood counts and bone marrow evaluations, to differentiate reactive polyclonal increases from pathological
monoclonal expansions.

Monitoring IgM can aid in diagnosing and tracking disease progression or therapeutic response. For instance, a sharp rise in
IgM following treatment might signal a transient inflammatory rebound or emerging infection, whereas a slow but persistent
increase in IgM could indicate a plasma cell dyscrasia or chronic immune stimulation. Evaluating IgM alongside IgG and IgA
allows for a more detailed assessment of immunologic status, enabling targeted intervention strategies.",50,300,0.5,3,56,300,0.56,3,mg/dL,g/L,"Selective IgM Deficiency

Immature Granulocytes - %,"Immature granulocytes (iGs) are precursors of granulocyte white blood cells, i.e., eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, and
reflect an early response to infection or inflammation. The level of IGs in circulation often increases proportionally to the
severity of the condition. Higher levels are observed with sepsis, surgical infections, SIRS, hematological malignancy, and more
severe pancreatitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, and COVID-19. A low IG is likely associated with the absence of severe infection
or inflammation and may be zero in healthy individuals.","Granulocytes are white blood cell types that include eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, the most common granulocytes
(Pagana 2022). Immature granulocytes (IGs) include promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes and are precursors to
neutrophils, which play a critical role in fighting fungal and bacterial infections (Georgakopoulou 2022).

Increased production of immature white blood cells causes a “shift to the left” in WBC production, usually in response to
infection or inflammation. Immature granulocyte measurement is more accurate for identifying infection than measuring band
cells, which are more mature neutrophil precursors (Prabu 2020). Most healthy individuals do not have IGs in circulation or
maintain a level of 0.5% or 0.03 k/cumm or below, although 0-1% has been considered the standard range for 1G% (Lipinski
2017).

A retrospective observational study of 200 suspected infection inpatients found that those with positive blood cultures had
significantly higher IG counts and 1G% (0.70 k/cumm and 4.86 |G%) than those with negative cultures (0.17 k/cumm and 1.58
IG%), respectively. An IG count above 0.3 k/cumm and IG% above 3% had a greater than 90% specificity for sepsis.
Researchers suggest that lower IG counts of 0.03 k/cumm and IG% of 0.5% and above can be used as an initial screen for
bacteremia (Senthilnayagam 2012).

Immature granulocyte production is stimulated by TNF-alpha and interleukin-1, inflammatory compounds that contribute to
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (Lipinski 2017). Measuring IG can help differentiate between infective and
non-infective SIRS within the first 48 hours of SIRS diagnosis (Nierhaus 2013). Elevated |G counts, and percentages may help
differentiate between noninfective inflammation and sepsis and help identify sepsis early, avoiding a critical delay in care
(Bhansaly 2022). Generally, an IG% above 3% has been associated with sepsis, while an !1G% below should rule out sepsis
(Ayres 2019). Immature granulocytes are earlier indicators of infection than band cells and can be significantly elevated in
pancreatitis, sickle cell disease, liver abscess, COVID-19, and infective complications following cardiac surgery (Turkes 2022).

An elevation in immature granulocytes may reflect prolonged stimulation of the bone marrow accompanied by a prolonged
innate immune response. This can aggravate inflammation further and contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and more severe infections such as COVID-19 (Choto 2022). Measuring IGs may be more helpful in predicting the
severity of acute pancreatitis than total WBCs or CRP. A cohort study of 77 acute pancreatitis (AP) patients found that IG%
was significantly higher in those with severe versus mild or moderate AP. Results indicated that IG% above 0.6% had a
sensitivity and specificity above 90% for predicting severe AP early in the disease (Lipinski 2017).

The immature granulocyte count may help predict more severe and complicated appendicitis. Immature granulocyte count
and percentages were significantly higher in complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis in a retrospective cross-sectional
study of 99 acute appendicitis patients and 41 controls. Complicated appendicitis is characterized by increased post-op
complications, delayed recovery, increased length of hospitalization, and increased cost of care. Subjects with complicated
appendicitis had a median IG count of 0.03 10-3/uL (20%) versus 0.02 10-3/uL (10%) with simple appendicitis. Controts had a
median IG of 0.01 10-3/uL (0-10%) (Turkes 2022).

treat severe AC as it can be associated with perforation, abscess, gangrene, and a mortality rate that can exceed 10%.
Elevations in neutrophil/ymphocyte count and CRP also helped identify severe AC (Unal 2022).

A significantly higher percentage of immature granulocytes was observed in individuals who did not survive an ST-segmented

blood. Excess insulin is associated with greater risks of heart attack, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes.","Insulin has the following physiological roles in the body:

1. Lowers elevated blood sugar

2. Shifts metabolism into storage mode

3. Converts glucose and protein to fat

sign that this individual is possibly in an insulin-resistant phase, also known as a pre-diabetic state.

Early stage of Hyperglycemia/Diabetes

If fasting insulin is elevated along with elevated serum glucose and Hemoglobin AIC, diabetes is probable. Serum triglycerides
are often higher than the total cholesterol level in patients with diabetes. Urinary glucose may be increased, HDL levels
decreased, and BUN and creatinine are frequently increased with the renal damage associated with diabetes. Follow-up with

table salt is also a good source of iodine. lodine intake below 20 ug/day will likely cause hypothyroidism.","The term “iodine deficiency disorders” refers to a range of adverse health effects including goiter, cretinism, growth
impairment, hypothyroidism, pregnancy loss, and infant mortality.

Assessment of iodine status can be further enhanced by measuring serum thyroglobulin and urinary iodine concentration
(UIC).

The minimum physiological need for iodine is 150-250 ug/day though normal daily intake may reach 500 micrograms per day.
A significant amount may come from iodized salt, although other foods such as dairy and bread may be directly or indirectly

Iron - Serum,"Serum iron reflects iron that is bound to serum proteins such as transferrin. Serum iron levels will begin to fall somewhere
between the depletion of the iron stores and the development of anemia. Increased iron levels are associated with liver
dysfunction, conditions of iron overload (hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis), and infections. Decreased iron levels are
associated with iron deficiency anemia, hypochlorhydria, and internal bleeding. The degree of iron deficiency is best
appreciated with ferritin, TIBC, and % transferrin saturation levels.","70% of the iron in the body is in the form of hemoglobin. The remaining 30% is found in storage form in the liver, spleen, and
bone marrow. The average intake of iron is about 10 mg/day, and only about 10% is absorbed. Iron is best absorbed when
taken about 45-50 minutes away from food. Dairy products, foods with high fiber contents, coffee, tea, and meat inhibit
absorption. Vitamin C enhances absorption.

The majority of body iron comes from dietary sources in the form of ferric iron, which has to be reduced into ferrous iron after
ingestion in order to be absorbed, a process that requires stomach acid and vitamin C. Iron is absorbed primarily in the
duodenum and jejunum. Once absorbed, iron travels in the blood attached to a beta globulin molecule called transferrin. The
RBC precursors in the bone marrow use a large proportion of the iron. About 60% of the remainder is stored in the

bone marrow, liver, and spleen as ferritin, and 40% as hemosiderin.

The serum iron measurement reflects iron bound to serum protein, the most predominant of which is transferrin and at any
one time about 1/3rd of the transferrin is saturated with iron. Serum iron relies both on the quantity of iron present and the
amount of transferrin available.

Many physicians make the mistake of only ordering RBC and indices when investigating iron excess or iron deficiency anemia.
Without the total serum iron and other iron tests, such as ferritin, TIBC, and % transferrin saturation, the degree of

iron deficiency anemia or iron excess cannot be appreciated.

Ordering serum iron without a serum ferritin and TIBC has very little clinical value.

Diurnal variations in serum iron levels have been noted. The peak value occurs most often in the morning.",40,190,7.16,34.01,85,130,15.22,23.27,ug/dL,umol/L,"Anemia- iron deficiency

This is the most prevalent anemia worldwide. The major causes are dietary inadequacies, malabsorption, increased iron loss,
and increased iron requirements e.g. pregnancy. If there is a decreased serum iron with a decreased MCH, MCV, and MCHC,
ferritin, % transferrin saturation and/or HGB and/or HCT, and increased RDW, then iron deficiency anemia is probable. If TIBC is
increased, internal/microscopic bleeding is possible and should be ruled out with reticulocyte count, urinalysis, and/or stool
analysis. If serum phosphorous is decreased and serum globulin is increased, iron anemia may be secondary to
hypochlorhydria.

Hypochlorhydria

A low serum iron level is often associated with hypochlorhydria. Adequate levels of stomach acid are necessary for iron
absorption. Hypochlorhydria is possible with low serum iron and an increased total globulin. Hypochlorhydria is probable if the
BUN is also increased and/or serum phosphorous is decreased.

Internal bleeding and internal microscopic bleeding

A decreased total serum iron may be due to internal bleeding. TIBC, transferrin, and reticulocyte count will be elevated. HGB
and HCT may be decreased or normal depending on the severity of the bleeding. Internal microscopic bleeding may present
with a decreased TIBC and an elevated reticulocyte count. If this pattern is present, internal bleeding must be ruled out with
reticulocyte count, urinalysis, and/or stool analysis. Refer to a doctor qualified to diagnose and treat internal bleeding.","Liver dysfunction

A high serum iron may be a sign of liver dysfunction. If the serum iron is increased along with increased liver enzymes, liver
dysfunction is probable.

Hemochromatosis/ hemosiderosis/iron overload

Hemochromatosis is a disease produced by an excess absorption of iron, which leads to deposition of excess iron in the
tissues, especially the liver. Hemochromatosis refers to the hereditary iron storage disorder whereas hemosiderosis refers to
the non-hereditary form. Laboratory changes include an increased serum iron , a decreased TIBC, an increased % transferrin
saturation, and an increased ferritin level. AST is usually elevated.

Iron conversion problem

If the serum iron is normal or increased with a decreased RBC, HGB, or HCT, consider that there may be an inability of the
body to convert inorganic iron (the type found in serum iron) into hemoglobin (organic iron). There is probably a need for B12,
folic acid, B6, and/or copper.

Lactic Acid,"Serum Lactic Acid measures the concentration of lactic acid in the blood, which is produced during anaerobic metabolism
when oxygen availability is insufficient for normal cellular respiration. Elevated serum lactic acid levels, often referred to as
lactic acidosis, can be indicative of tissue hypoxia, sepsis, shock, or metabolic disorders like liver faiture or renal insufficiency.
Lactic acid levels may also rise due to certain toxins, medications, or in conditions causing significant muscle injury
(rhabdomyolysis) or acute hypoperfusion. It is important to differentiate between Type A lactic acidosis (which is typically due
to tissue hypoxia or shock) and Type B lactic acidosis (which is associated with metabolic or systemic conditions like diabetes,
kidney failure, or toxic exposures). Elevated levels can assist in assessing the severity of illness and can guide therapy in critical
care settings.","Lactic acid levels provide insight into the adequacy of oxygen delivery to tissues and the efficiency of cellular respiration. Type
A lactic acidosis arises from tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxia—seen in shock, sepsis, or cardiac failure—where oxygen supply
cannot meet cellular demands, leading to increased anaerobic metabolism. Type B lactic acidosis, on the other hand, occurs
without overt tissue hypoxia and is typically associated with underlying metabolic or systemic conditions like diabetes, renal
insufficiency, liver disease, or certain medications (e.g., metformin) and toxins (e.g., cyanide).

A critical aspect of lactic acid interpretation is differentiating between these subtypes, as management strategies differ. Type
A lactic acidosis requires restoring adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation, often through intravenous fluids, vasopressors,
or cardiac support. Type B lactic acidosis necessitates investigating and addressing the underlying metabolic or toxic insult.
Elevated lactate levels can guide therapy intensity, especially in sepsis, where serial lactate measurements help gauge
response to interventions. While low lactate is rarely problematic, it may reflect a well-oxygenated state, minimal metabolic
stress, or a less common metabolic anomaly.

Because lactic acidosis can rapidty worsen and lead to organ failure, prompt recognition and management are critical.
Evaluating concurrent lab tests such as arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, and blood glucose
helps clinicians pinpoint whether lactic acidosis is primarily due to poor perfusion or an underlying metabolic disturbance.
Early, aggressive treatment of the root cause—be it septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or a toxic ingestion—can significantly
improve outcomes in patients with elevated lactic acid levels.",3.6,16.21,0.4,1.8,3.6,16.21,0.4,1.8,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Well-Oxygenated State

risk of a cardiovascular incident.

LDH,"LDH represents a group of enzymes that are involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decreased levels of LDH often correspond
to hypoglycemia (especially reactive hypoglycemia), pancreatic function, and glucose metabolism. Increased levels are used to
evaluate the presence of tissue damage to the cell causing a rupture in the cellular cytoplasm. LDH is found in many of the
tissues of the body, especially the heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, red blood cells, and lungs. Damage to any of these
tissues will cause an elevated serum LDH level.","Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the enzyme that is involved in the catalytic conversion of pyruvate into factate in the
presence of NAD/NADH that occurs in every cell. Lactate is a major product of exercising muscle cells and red blood cell
metabolism. Pyruvate is converted into lactate primarily under anaerobic conditions (some tissues and cell types also produce
lactate under aerobic conditions). The lactate formed can be recycled. It is released into the blood stream and is eventually
taken up by the jiver. The liver converts it back into glucose, which is released back into the blood stream where it is taken up
by muscles recovering from strenuous exercise, red blood cells, and other tissues.
The total LDH level is composed of fractions of 5 LDH isoenzymes. Each of these isoenzymes can be fractionated by
electrophoresis into their constituent fraction.
Since LDH is found in almost every tissue in the body, an elevated total LDH level has limited diagnostic value by itself. Anyone
with a significantly increased total LDH level shouid have an LDH isoenzyme study perfo differential diagnosis. ",100,200,100,200,140,200,140,200,IU/L,IU/L,"Reactive Hypoglycemia
A common finding in reactive hypoglycemia is a decreased fasting blood glucose along with a decreased LDH. Hemoglobin
AIC levels may also be reduced. LDH is an important enzyme for pyruvate metabolism in glycolysis and is associated with
pancreatic function and glucose metabolism.","Liver/Biliary dysfunction

If LDH is increased with increased total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, AST. GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase, liver/biliary
dysfunction is probable. LDH is usually increased in liver congestion. Liver infection (hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, EBV,
CMV etc.) should be ruled out.

Cardiovascular disease

Elevated LDH levels are seen in cardiac dysfunction due to tissue stress and/or damage. Total LDH levels are elevated in about
90-95% of patients with acute Mi. LDH levels become elevated about 24-48 hours after an Mi. With a suspected MI, the AST is
increased 4-10 times above the reference range in an acute myocardial infarct, peaking after 24 hours and normalizing after 3-
4 days. Secondary rises in AST levels suggest a recurring MI or continued infarction. Patients with a triglyceride level that is
higher than the total cholesterol level and a decreased HDL have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

Anemia- B12/folate deficiency (megaloblastic)

Serum LDH levels are elevated in about 85% of those with megaloblastic anemia, which is primarily caused by a deficiency in
vitamin B12 and/or folate. The megaloblastic changes cause increased destruction of the red blood cells in the marrow, which
is reflected in the increased LDH levels. LDH can be used to help identify the type of anemia present. Isoenzyme fractionation
typically shows an elevated LDH-1 In megaloblastic anemia. Other value changes seen with megaloblastic anemia include
increased MCH, MCV, RDW, serum iron and decreased RBCs, and HGB.

Anemia- hemolytic

Serum LDH levels are elevated in most people with hemolytic anemia. LDH levels can help assist in ruling out hemolytic
anemia. A normal LDH level with substantial anemia seen in other values makes hemolytic anemia less likely. An elevation of
LDH-1 isoenzyme fraction that occurs with hemolytic anemia contributes to the increase in the total serum LDH value. In about
60% of hemolytic anemias, the LDH-1 and LDH-2 fractions will be reversed, with a much higher LDH-2 level.

Non-specific tissue inflammation

An increased LDH level will be seen with non-specific tissue inflammation. Basophils will almost always be elevated. During
inflammation, basophils deliver heparin to the affected tissue to prevent clotting. ESR will be increased along with a decreased
serum albumin, total protein, and globulin.

Tissue destruction

Any type of tissue destruction in the body will cause the rupture of the cell cytoplasm and the release of LDH. Damage and
secondary inflammation will cause an increase in serum LDH. It is our recommendation that any patient who has an increase of
more than 10 U/L above the standard or “normal” reference range should have an LDH Isoenzyme fraction study to determine
the exact location of the tissue damage.

Viral infection

LDH levels are usually elevated in about 95% of cases of infectious mononucleosis and Epstein Barr infection (EBV). LDH is
usually elevated in cytomegalovirus infection (CMV). Other values usually take time to increase. You may expect the following
changes: decreased WBCs in the first week, increased WBCs by 2nd week of illness, increased alkaline phosphatase and
SGOT/AST (about 5-14 days after onset of illness), increased GGT (about 7-21 days after onset of illness).",,"© Hypothyroidism

Increased risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular risk and stroke

An increased LDL level is associated with the development of atherosclerosis and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease
and stroke. If there is an increased triglyceride level in relation to total cholesterol with an increased uric acid level, a decreased
HDL and an increased LDL, atherosclerosis is probable. Platelet levels may also be increased. Homocysteine levels are

potential risk of developing atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. If LDL is increased with an increased total cholesterol and
an increased LDL/HDL ratio and an increased level of triglycerides with HDL less than of the total cholesterol, hyperlipidemia is
probable.

Oxidative stress

Increased LDL levels are associated with increasing free radical activity and oxidative stress. The peroxidation of LDL may
promote the accumulation of cholesterol in the macrophages and smooth muscle cells, which can lead to atherosclerotic
plaque formation.

Fatty liver (early development) and Liver congestion

If LDL levels are increased, along with increased triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, and HDL levels are decreased, the
early development of fatty liver is possible. Liver congestion, due to the fatty liver, should be considered if total cholesterol is
above, triglycerides are increased, and the SGPT/ALT is below.

with a favorable ApoA is associated with insulin resistance, smaller LDL size, systemic inflammation, and tower circulating
“traditional” lipids, even when LDL cholesterol is considered ideal. In such cases, LDL may be depleted of cholesterol but still
atherogenic.

risk.

Evaluating LDL particle size may help identify cardiometabolic risk even in individuals with “low risk” levels of LDL cholesterol,
non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

It is important to determine the breakdown of small versus large LDL particles because just determining “average” LDL
particle size may not identify an excess of the more dangerous small LDL particles which are detrimental.

LDL size ranges from small and dense (pattern A) to large and buoyant (pattern B).

Small dense LDL particles (smaller than 20.5 nm) have less cholestero! but more triglyceride than larger particles and they can
more easily penetrate the artery wall and become oxidized and glycated. Having more sdLDL particles is associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

LDL particte size can be increased (improved) via weight loss, exercise, blood glucose control, and a healthy plant-based diet

inflammation, oxidation, and glycation making them more atherogenic. Small dense LDL particles also carry fewer antioxidant
vitamins and are more susceptible to oxidation and glycation and are more apt to promote inflammation.

predisposition that is triggered by weight gain and unhealthy lifestyle habits though it can also occur in those who are not
overweight.

LDL Size (NMR),"LDL Size is a measurement of the size of the LDL particles. A low LDL Size is reflective of having a lot of small dense LDL
(sdLDL) particles, which poses the greatest CVD and insulin resistance risk even though they have less cholesterol than larger
particles.","Most cholesterol in the blood is transported on low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The amount of cholesterol carried by each LDL
particle can vary, creating a range of LDL particle sizes and a range of susceptibility to oxidative damage and cardiovascular
risk.

Evaluating LDL particle size may help identify cardiometabolic risk even in individuals with “low risk” levels of LDL cholesterol,
non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

It is important to determine the breakdown of small versus large LDL particles because just determining “average” LDL
particle size may not identify an excess of the more dangerous small LDL particles which are detrimental.

LDL size ranges from small and dense (pattern A) to large and buoyant (pattern B).

Small dense LDL particles (smaller than 20.5 nm) have less cholesterol but more triglyceride than larger particles and they can
more easily penetrate the artery wall and become oxidized and glycated. Having more sdLDL particles is associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

LDL particle size can be increased (improved) via weight loss, exercise, blood glucose control, and a healthy plant-based diet
containing raw nuts, and fiber, especially psyllium fiber and oat bran.

There are a variety of methods for measuring lipoprotein size and concentration and their results are not interchangeable.

infiltrate the artery wall and promote inflammation. It contains fewer antioxidant vitamins, making it more susceptible to

Therefore, small dense LDL particles are more apt to cause atherosclerotic plaques and arterial wall damage and contribute
more to cardiovascular disease than large buoyant LDL particles.

research indicates that leptin not only plays an important role in the body’s response to food deprivation, but is also involved
in a diverse array of physiological functions including angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, immunity, bone formation, sexual
development, reproduction, and blood sugar regulation.

In regards to blood sugar regulation and metabolism, insulin and leptin work synergistically to control the quality and rate of
one’s metabolism via nervous system control. Insulin works mostly at the individual cellular level, signaling the cell whether to
burn or store fat and whether to utilize that energy for maintenance and repair or reproduction. Leptin then communicates
with the brain via the hypothalamus about how much energy (fat) the body has stored, and whether it needs more, should
burn some, and whether it is an advantageous time for the body to reproduce.

Increasing leptin levels in the blood correlate with increasing body fat. Therefore, obese individuals have the highest levels of
leptin, suggesting that these individuals are insensitive to leptin or “leptin resistant” as opposed to suffering from leptin
deficiency. “Leptin resistance” is caused by the same general mechanism as “insulin resistance”. As the hormone concentration
level in the blood becomes elevated, the corresponding receptor cells become resistant to the hormone over time, thereby
requiring an even higher concentration of hormone to produce the desired effect. In the case of leptin, as fat storage increases,
more leptin is produced, which over time, causes the receptor cells in the hypothalamus and other target tissues to become
“resistant” to leptin. The effect is a reduction in the feeling of satiation after meals, similar to the effect caused by low leptin
levels. Therefore, these individuals feel like they are hungry all the time so they eat more and gain more body fat perpetuating
this cycle.

In lean individuals, leptin along with adiponectin, are pivotal in preventing ectopic lipid accumulation, which is the
accumulation of fat outside the usual fat stores i.e. in places other than adipose tissue. A drop in adiponectin coupled with
leptin resistance leads to ectopic lipid accumulation in various tissues and organs, especially in the abdomen. When this occurs
in muscle, it leads to insulin insensitivity (a relative inability of insulin to facilitate the disposal of glucose in tissues). Insulin
insensitivity is the first step towards the development of both type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Lipid accumulation in

LH - Female,"Luteinizing hormone (LH), produced by the anterior pituitary gland in the brain, is instrumental in regulating the menstrual cycle and ovulation, with a mid-cycle LH surge prompting the release of an egg from the ovary.

Elevated LH levels in this group might signify PCOS, highlighted by a notable LH-to-FSH ratio imbalance, or conditions like premature ovarian failure. For postmenopausal women, while high LH levels are expected due to ceased ovarian egg production, consistently low levels might hint at potential pituitary gland issues or other health concerns.","LH and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) play a dual role in the menstrual cycle. FSH stimulates the growth of the ovarian follicle and causes the production of estrogen by the follicle. The production of progesterone by the developed follicle stimulates the release of LH from the anterior pituitary. Levels continue to rise until ovulation is triggered by the mid-cycle increase in LH and the egg is released from the follicle. 
LH is also vital for the formation of the corpus luteum in the ovary. LH also helps the corpus luteum produce progesterone and is necessary to maintain the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

LH - Male,"Luteinizing Hormone (LH) is produced by the anterior pituitary and is a crucial regulator of male reproductive function. In
males, LH stimulates Leydig celis in the testes to synthesize and secrete testosterone, which is essential for the development of
male secondary sexual characteristics, spermatogenesis, and overall reproductive health. LH is also involved in the adrenal
synthesis of hormones such as progesterone and androstenedione. Because testosterone exerts a negative feedback effect on
the hypothalamus and pituitary, exogenous testosterone therapy commonly suppresses LH production. Understanding LH
dynamics is particularly important in Functional Medicine settings, where many patients are on testosterone supplementation.","LH stimulates Leydig cells in the testes to produce and secrete testosterone. As the testosterone travels through the
bloodstream it passes through the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary where it stimulates the classic negative-feedback
loop to decrease LH.

A low LH level in a male patient may be due to anterior pituitary hypofunction, where the pituitary gland fails to produce
adequate gonadotropins. However, in the context of testosterone therapy, low LH is an expected finding resulting from the
negative feedback of circulating testosterone on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. It is important to distinguish
between therapy-induced suppression and true pituitary insufficiency. In cases of pituitary dysfunction, one would expect
concomitant abnormalities in other pituitary hormones, and further evaluation with a full pituitary panel may be warranted.
Elevated LH levels are often indicative of primary testicular failure or hypogonadism, wherein the testes are unable to produce
sufficient testosterone despite high levels of gonadotropins. This can be seen in conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome or
idiopathic testicular failure, and is frequently associated with symptoms of androgen deficiency. In patients on testosterone
therapy, persistently high LH levels may be concerning, as they suggest that the exogenous hormone is not adequately
suppressing the endogenous gonadal axis, or that the testes have an intrinsic defect. Comprehensive evaluation should include

LP-IR Score (NMR),"Insulin resistance (IR) is a metabolic condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to elevated
glucose and insulin levels in the blood. This condition is a precursor to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and is linked to increased risks
of cardiovascular diseases. The Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance Index (LP-IR) is a metric used to assess insulin resistance; it
analyzes lipoprotein particle sizes and concentrations, which are metabolic health indicators.

An increased LP-IR score is associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, T2DM, and cardiovascular complications,
making early detection and lifestyle interventions crucial for managing and potentially reversing insulin resistance. The LP-IR
May provide early detection of IR in apparently low-risk individuals.

A low LP-IR generally indicates a low risk of insulin resistance.","Insulin resistance (IR) occurs when liver and peripheral cells become resistant to insulin, causing blood glucose and insulin
levels to rise, creating metabolic dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. Homeostasis
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) calculations, based on fasting glucose and fasting insulin or C-peptide,
primarily reflect hepatic IR, while glucose disposal rate (GDR) reflects peripheral IR ¢i.e., muscle and adipose tissue). Insulin
resistance often precedes a diagnosis of T2DM and can be measured and addressed prophylactically. The Lipoprotein Insulin
Resistance Index (LP-IR) is strongly associated with HOMA-IR and GDR and can be used to evaluate insulin resistance. The LP-
IR algorithm is based on six NMR lipoprotein classes associated with IR: VLDL size, large VLDL particles, HDL size, large HDL
particles, smatl LDL particles, and LDL size, in order of relevance. Alteration in the size and concentration of lipoprotein
particles is associated with insulin resistance and T2DM (Shalaurova 2014). An LP-IR score of zero indicates the greatest insulin
sensitivity, while a score of 100 reflects the most insulin resistance (Fosam 2022).

Research suggests LP-IR may predict future T2DM by identifying insulin resistance in low-risk subjects years before clinical
dysglycemia is detected. Three studies identified this trend: the MESA cohort study, the JUPITER study, and the Women’s
Health Study ¢Flores-Guerrero 2019).

Data from the MESA and MUSC studies were evaluated, and higher LP-IR scores were highly correlated with higher
triglycerides, fasting insulin, and lower HDL-C. A linear relationship was observed between LP-IR and HOMA-IR and LP-IR and
GDR. The LP-IR also detected insulin resistance even in normal-weight subjects and those with glucose parameters within the
normal range (Shalaurova 2014).

A data review from the MESA prospective cohort study confirmed that type 2 diabetes incidence was significantly associated
with higher LP-IR, large VLDL-P, small LDL-P, smaller HDL and LDL size, and larger VLDL size. Mean LP-IR was 54.3 and 40.7 in
those diagnosed with and without T2DM, respectively. Researchers note that lower HDL-C and higher triglyceride levels and
triglyceride:HDL-C ratios were also robustly associated with incident T2DM (Mackey 2015).

Diabetes risk in the Women’s Health Study was lowest with an LP-IR below 30 and highest above 67. Those with an LP-IR
below 30 also had a mean baseline triglyceride level of 74 mg/dL (0.84 mmol/L), total cholesterol 202 mg/dL (5.23 mmol/L),
LDL-C 113 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L), HDL-C 65.1 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L), Apolipoprotein B 86.3 mg/dL (0.86 g/L), Apolipoprotein A-1
of 161 mg/dL (1.61 g/L), and hs-CRP of 1 mg/L, and hemoglobin AIC 4.9% (Harada 2017).

Secondary analysis of data from 9.180 subjects taking part in the JUPITER statin study found that LP-IR predicted T2DM risk in
the placebo group and those taking statins. Taking statins is considered a risk factor for T2DM. Diabetes incidence was lowest,
with an LP-IR of 40 or below (Dugani 2016).

LP-IR was assessed in a cross-sectional study of 55 South Asian volunteers, a group at increased risk of insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes. Researchers suggest an optimal LP-IR cut-off above 48 for identifying insulin resistance (Fosam 2022). This
cut-off is also considered strongly predictive of IR in individuals of European ancestry. However, LP-IR scores may not detect
IR in African Americans despite a mean LP-IR of 28.9, as demonstrated in a cohort study of 518 subjects. This population can
be at increased cardiometabolic risk with obesity, abnormal glucose tolerance, and higher small LDL particles but have low
triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle levels and decreasing LP-IR scores. Men had significantly higher LP-IR scores than women,
ie., 34 versus 23. Further screening for cardiometabolic risk should be carried out in this population (Sharma 2021).

LP-IR can be a valuable tool in NAFLD evaluation. Tissue insulin resistance is closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), a disorder characterized by an accumulation of triglycerides in the liver and impaired insulin clearance. The
LP-IR score may better assess hepatic insulin resistance in NAFLD than IR markers dependent on fasting insulin, which may
not accurately reflect hepatic insulin exposure. A retrospective study of 93 NAFLD patients found LP-IR predicted IR and liver
fat accumulation in non-diabetic subjects without fibrosis (Vittal 2020).

Lifestyle interventions can have a profound effect on insulin sensitivity. An education and lifestyle intervention based on diet
changes, strength and endurance plan, and stress management significantly improved LP-IR in subjects with type 2 diabetes,
coronary artery disease, or at a high risk of these disorders. A strict vegetarian (intensive intervention) and a Mediterranean-
style diet (moderate intervention) significantly reduced both groups’ LP-IR and large VLDL particles. Large VLDL particles are
rich in triglycerides and are associated positively with the development of insulin resistance and coronary artery calcification.
The more intensive vegetarian diet was more effective for subjects with a severe LP-IR of 75 or above than the moderate
Mediterranean intervention (Ellsworth 2016).

Interestingly, a higher LP-IR was associated with lower mortality in a study of 1382 heart failure patients with an ejection
fraction below 50%. LP-IR and mean HDL particle size were inversely and significantly associated with mortality in this group.
The lowest and highest 5-year survival probabilities were observed with an LP-IR of 0-20 and above 60, respectively. Those
with a higher LP-IR tended to have tower NT-proBNP levels but were more likely to smoke and have diabetes. Researchers
note that higher total and LDL cholesterol levels are associated with improved survival rates in heart failure and point out that
cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins can be protective due to their antioxidant and toxin-binding effects (Turecamo 2024).",0,45%,0,45%,0,27%,0,27%,,,"Decreased Mortality with Heart Failure

A lower LP-IR has been associated with decreased mortality rates in heart failure patients, presumably because lipoproteins
can have antioxidant and toxin-binding effects.

Reduced Insulin Resistance and Cardiometabolic Disease

A low LP-IR generally indicates a reduced risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It is also
associated with lower levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the blood and a more favorable lipoprotein profile.","Insulin Resistance

An elevated LP-IR score indicates an increase in trigtyceride-rich atherogenic lipoproteins and alterations in lipoprotein size
that reflect increasing insulin resistance.

Non-alcoholic/Metabolic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

NAFLD is characterized by a buildup of triglyceride fat in the liver and is associated with insulin resistance, especially hepatic
insulin resistance. The LP-IR may be a better tool to assess insulin resistance in NAFLD than those that depend on fasting
insulin, which may not reflect hepatic insulin resistance.

Lp-PLA2,"Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA2) is an enzyme produced by a wide range of cells and activated by the
presence of oxidized lipoproteins. Lp-PLA2 is considered a specific marker of atherosclerosis-related vascular inflammation.
Lp-PLA2 helps predict coronary heart disease and risk in moderate-risk patients. An Lp-PLA2 in the optimal range signifies a
reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.","Approximately 80-85% of Lp-PLA2 interacts with oxidized LDL and cleaves oxidized phospholipids, reducing the
atherogenicity of oxLDL. However, like a double-edged sword, it promotes the release of pro-inflammatory compounds,
contributing to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque.

Approximately 15-20% interacts with oxidized HDL and may have more anti-atherogenic action.

Lp-PLA2 is considered a specific marker of atherosclerosis-related vascular inflammation as it does not increase until plaque
becomes advanced and inflamed. It can accumulate within the plaque, further perpetuating the disease process. It is
predominantly expressed in the necrotic plaque center and is associated with more vulnerable plaque.

Measurement of Lp-PLA2 is a valuable tool for monitoring high-risk patients with unstable plaque.

It can also help predict coronary heart disease and the risk of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in moderate-risk
patients such as those with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is
considered predictive in clinically healthy individuals and in the general population as well.

Lp-PLA2 is not influenced by acute illness, differentiating it from C-reactive protein as an inflammatory marker. Increases in Lp-
PLA2 are not observed until plaque advances and becomes inflamed.

Lp-PLA2 is not elevated in systemic inflammation and may be more specific to vascular inflammation, helping to differentiate
vascular inflammation from other inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.

Magnesium - RBC,"Magnesium is an essential mineral that participates in over 300 enzymatic reactions, including carbohydrate metabolism,
protein synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, and muscle contraction. Although serum magnesium is often measured, only about 1-
5% of total body magnesium is found in the extracellular fluid, with the vast majority residing intracellularly—especially in red
blood cells, soft tissues, and bone. RBC Magnesium is a measure of the intracellular concentration of magnesium and is
considered a more accurate reflection of overall magnesium status. Magnesium homeostasis is regulated by gastrointestinal
absorption (mainly in the small intestine), renal excretion, and hormonal influences such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), which
modulates renal tubular reabsorption.","Measuring RBC Magnesium provides a more precise picture of magnesium available for cellular functions compared to serum
magnesium, which can be influenced by acute shifts or variations in protein binding. Low RBC Magnesium (hypomagnesemia)
may result from poor dietary intake, gastrointestinal malabsorption (exacerbated by conditions like hypochlorhydria), or
increased urinary losses due to conditions such as diabetes or the use of certain diuretics. Clinically, low magnesium levels can
manifest as muscle cramps, spasms, arrhythmias, or even seizures, and can disrupt the balance with calcium, leading to
additional metabolic complications.

Conversely, high RBC Magnesium (hypermagnesemia) is less frequently observed and is typically linked to renal dysfunction or
failure, where the kidneys are unable to excrete magnesium effectively. In such cases, the retention of magnesium may be
accompanied by other electrolyte abnormalities and signs of renal impairment. Although high magnesium levels are generally
less common, they require careful evaluation in the context of overall kidney function, as they can contribute to neuromuscular
depression, hypotension, and cardiac conduction disturbances.

Understanding the interplay between serum and intracellular magnesium is critical because alterations in RBC Magnesium
levels often provide an early indication of metabolic imbalances before serum changes become evident. As such, measuring
RBC Magnesium is particularly valuable in patients with chronic conditions, those on medications that affect renal function, or
in scenarios where symptoms of magnesium deficiency or excess are present despite normal serum magnesium values.",4,6.8,1.66,2.82,6,6.8,2.48,2.82,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Magnesium Deficiency
Consider that the patient has a need for magnesium if the RBC and Serum Magnesium level is decreased.

Increased Renal Losses
Conditions such as diabetes, chronic alcohol use, or the use of diuretics can increase magnesium excretion, thereby lowering
RBC magnesium.

Metabolic and Neuromuscular Manifestations
Low RBC magnesium is associated with muscle cramps, neuromuscular irritability, arrhythmias, and impaired calcium
metabolism, highlighting its importance in energy production and cellular function.","Renal Dysfunction
Impaired kidney function, as seen in chronic kidney disease or renal failure, decreases magnesium clearance, leading to
elevated intracellular magnesium levets. Laboratory findings often include increased BUN, serum creatinine, and alterations in
other electrolyte levels.

Thyroid hypofunction
RBC magnesium may be increased in either primary thyroid hypofunction or secondary thyroid hypofunction due to anterior
pituitary hypofunction. With primary hypothyroidism, the magnesium levels may be increased along with an increased TSH.
With secondary thyroid hypofunction due to anterior pituitary hypofunction, the magnesium levels may be increased along
with a decreased TSH.

Excessive Supplementation or Exogenous Intake
Although less common, excessive intake of magnesium through supplements or medications may contribute to higher RBC
magnesium, particularly if renal excretion is compromised.

Acid-Base Imbalances
In certain scenarios, alterations in acid-base balance (e.g., acidosis) can influence magnesium distribution, aithough the
primary driver of high RBC magnesium remains reduced renal clearance.","© Adrenal hyper-function

Magnesium - Serum,"Magnesium is important for many different enzymatic reactions, including carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis, nucleic
acid synthesis, and muscular contraction. Magnesium is also needed for energy production and is used by the body in the
blood clotting mechanism. An increased serum magnesium is associated with kidney dysfunction and thyroid hypofunction. A
decreased magnesium is a common finding with muscle cramps.","Magnesium is the second most common intracellular cation, after potassium. Only about 1-5% is found extracellularly. About
half of the body’s magnesium is found in the soft tissue and muscle cells. The remainder is found in the bone. About 1/3rd of
dietary magnesium is absorbed. Absorption takes place in the small intestine.
Serum magnesium exists in three different forms in the plasma:
1. About 50% of the magnesium in the plasma is in the free/ionized form and is freely diffusible through the cell
membrane.
2. 35% of the magnesium in the plasma is protein bound. Protein bound magnesium is primarily bound to albumin (75%)
and globulins (25%).
3. The remaining 15% of the magnesium in the plasma is complexed to other substances, such as phosphate or citrate, and
is freely diffusible through the cell membrane.
Magnesium is excreted by the kidney. Normally 95% of magnesium filtered by the glomerulus is reabsorbed in the tubule.
Parathyroid hormone plays a role in regulating blood magnesium levels through its action on renal tubular reabsorption.
Magnesium is important for many different enzymatic reactions, including carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis, nucleic
acid synthesis, and muscular contraction. Magnesium is also needed for oxidative phosphrylation and ATP production and is
used by the body in the blood clotting mechanism.

Serum magnesium is found intracellularly, and is therefore not the best method for assessing magnesium. If you need a more
accurate assessment of magnesium, we recommend running a red blood cell magnesium, because the RBCs contain 2-3 times
the concentration of magnesium found in the serum. Refer to specific laboratory ranges when running an intracellular WBC or
RBC magnesium level.

Magnesium is closely associated with calcium. A deficiency of one can affect the metabolism of the other. Magnesium plays an
important role in calcium absorption from the intestines. A magnesium deficiency causes calcium resorption from the bone,
which may cause calcification

Note: Part of the serum magnesium, like calcium, is bound to albumin. Check the serum albumin level to make sure that a
decrease in serum albumin is not the cause for a relative serum magnesium decrease and an albumin increase is not the cause
of a serum magnesium increase.",1.5,2.5,0.62,1.04,2.2,2.5,0.91,1.04,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Inadequate Dietary Intake and Malabsorption
Low magnesium levels can result from insufficient dietary intake, particularly in individuals consuming diets low in
Magnesium-rich foods. Malabsorption syndromes (e.g., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease) or hypochlorhydria may
further impair intestinal magnesium absorption.

Muscle Spasm
The laboratory results with muscle spasms are variable; however, decreased serum or RBC magnesium is a common finding.

Increased Renal Losses
Certain conditions, such as chronic alcoholism, uncontrolled diabetes, or diuretic use, may increase renal excretion of
Magnesium. This loss can contribute to persistently low serum magnesium levels, with subsequent neuromuscular and cardiac
manifestations.

Gastrointestinal Disorders
Malabsorption syndromes, chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, chronic
pancreatitis, prolonged nasogastric suction","Renal Dysfunction

Kidney dysfunction decreases kidney function, which causes increased magnesium retention, leading to increased serum levels
of magnesium. Increased BUN, serum creatinine, BUN/Creatinine ratio, Urine specific gravity, Uric acid, serum phosphorous,
LDH, and AST. You may also see serum electrolytes outside of their metabolic range.

Excessive Intake

Overconsumption of magnesium through supplements, magnesium-containing antacids, laxatives, or parenteral magnesium
administration can result in hypermagnesemia, particularly in patients with underlying renal insufficiency. This is often seen in
settings such as magnesium sulfate therapy for pre-eclampsia when renal function is compromised.

Thyroid hypofunction

Serum magnesium may be increased in either primary thyroid hypofunction or secondary thyroid hypofunction due to anterior
pituitary hypofunction. With primary hypothyroidism, the magnesium levels may be increased along with an increased TSH

decreased MCH and MCHC with a decreased uric acid, suspect a heavy metal body burden. Confirm with a hair analysis or
toxic element testing via blood or urine. The serum levels of the metals may also be increased, but in sub-acute conditions the
serum levels may be normal. The hair and urinary/blood tests will frequently reflect the increase before it is seen outside the
reference range in the serum.","Anemia- Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency
Bi2 and folic acid are needed for proper nucleus development. In situations of deficiency, the cytoplasm of the erythrocyte
continues to expand until the nucleus has reached its proper size. This leads to large red blood cells. If the MCHC is increased
and there is an increased MCH in conjunction with an increased MCV, an increased RDW, LDH (especially the LDH-1 isoenzyme
fraction), and a decreased uric acid level, the probability of vitamin B-12 or folic acid anemia is very high. This finding shouid
be confirmed with serum or urinary methylmalonic acid (vitamin B-12) and serum or urinary homocysteine (folic acid and
vitamin B-6). The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils (5 or more lobes in more than 5% of all neutrophils) has been
reported to be more sensitive and reliable than an elevated MCV in detecting megaloblastic anemia and is not affected by
coexisting iron deficiency.

Hypochlorhydria
Hypochlorhydria is possible with an increased MCHC, MCH, and/or MCV, especially with low serum iron and an increased or

MCV,"The MCV is a measurement of the volume in cubic microns of an average single red blood cell. MCV indicates whether the red
blood cell size appears normal (normocytic), small (microcytic), or large (macrocytic). An increase or decrease in MCV can
help determine the type of anemia present. An increased MCV is associated with B12, folate, or vitamin C deficiency. A
decreased MCV is associated with iron and B6 deficiency.","lf the MCV is greater than 89.9 cubic microns, the red celis are macrocytic; if the MCV is less than 82.0 cubic microns, the red
cells are microcytic; if the MCV is within the optimum range, the red cells are normocytic.

Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is one of the red blood cell indices used to differentiate anemia. It should always be
considered along with the MCH when determining whether or not a patient has a vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, or folic acid
anemia. MCV may be normal in patients that have both B 12/folate and iron deficiency anemia.",80,100,80,100,82,89.9,82,82.9,fL,fL,"Iron deficiency anemia
lron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent anemia worldwide. The major causes are:Dietary inadequacies, Malabsorption,
Increased iron loss, Increased iron requirements. If there is a decreased MCH, MCV, MCHC, HCT and/or HGB, and a decreased
serum iron, ferritin, % transferrin saturation, along with an elevated RDW, then iron anemia is probable. If TIBC is increased,
microscopic bleeding is possible and should be ruled out with reticulocyte count, urinalysis, and/or stool analysis. lron
deficiency anemia may be secondary to hypochlorhydria if serum phosphorous is decreased and serum globulin is increased.

Anemia- B6 deficiency
B6 anemia is not very common but possible given the deficiencies of B6 and other B complex vitamins. If there is a decreased
MCV, MCH, MCHC, HGB, and/or HCT and an increased or normal serum iron and/or ferritin, B6 anemia is possible. If there is a
decreased MCV, MCH, with a decreased AST, ALT or GGTP. B6 anemia is probable.

Internal bleeding
An internal bleed can slowly deplete the body of iron due to the loss of red blood cells causing a decreased MCV. Internal
Bleeding is a serious condition and should be referred to a specialist qualified to diagnose and treat this condition.","Anemia- Vitamin B12 and/or Folate deficiency
B12 and folate are needed for proper nucleus development. In situations of deficiency the cytoplasm of the erythrocyte
continues to expand until the nucleus has reached its proper size. This leads to large red blood cells. The probability of vitamin
B-12 or folate deficiency anemia increases when the MCV is increased. If there is also an increased MCH, RDW, MCHC, and LDH
(especially the LDH-1 isoenzyme fraction), and a decreased uric acid level the probability of vitamin B-12 or folic acid anemia is
very high. Serum or urinary methylmalonic acid is a good test for confirming vitamin B-12 deficiency. An elevated serum
homocysteine can help confirm folic acid and vitamin B-6 deficiency. The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils (5 or more

an elevated homocysteine is a strong indication that B12 deficiency is present. If both MMA and homocysteine are normal then
a B12 deficiency is unlikely.

Risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency include advanced age, hypochlorhydria, gastrointestinal surgery (gastric or ileal),
malabsorption, and long-term adherence to a vegan or vegetarian diet.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO),"Myeloperoxidase (MPO), an inflammatory enzyme produced by white blood cells is released when the interior artery wall is
damaged or inflamed. MPO further perpetuates vascular inflammation and triggers protease cascades that promote plaque
formation and vulnerability, respectively. MPO is able to generate damaging reactive oxygen species that ultimately cause
endothelial dysfunction.","Reactive species generated by MPO are able to oxidize the protein, lipid, and antioxidant components of LDL.
MPO is involved in:

e Lipid peroxidation, converting LDL to an atherogenic form and HDL to a dysfunctional form

e Destabilization and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques

e Vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction

e Increased vascular permeability
Fissures, erosions, or degrading collagen cap can trigger release of MPO in the bloodstream where it can be easily measured.
Circulating MPO in the blood is a specific marker of vascular inflammation and vulnerable plaque/erosions/ fissures. Levels
reflect the potential for plaque rupture associated with with damage to the blood vessel lining.
MPO levels are valuable biomarkers of oxidative stress. Measurement of MPO is useful in those with established heart disease,
hypertension, or diabetes; and those at risk for CVD, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
The use of additional biomarkers, e.g., N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein improve the risk stratification over MPO alone.

MPO also has strong antibacterial properties and plays a role in immune defense by generating compounds capable of killing
pathogens. Such action can also cause inflammation and tissue damage in the body.

Dietary antioxidants, primarily found in fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, and other plant-based foods, may help prevent
myeloperoxidase-induced oxidation.",0,469,0,469,0,400,0,400,pmol/L,pmol/L,"Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease
Low/optimal levels of MPO represent reduced risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and CVD-related events.

Reduced evidence of oxidative stress
Low/optimal levels of MPO suggest decreased presence of oxidative stress.

Myeloperoxidase deficiency
A genetic deficiency of MPO can lead to increased susceptibility to infection including Candida infection. MPO deficiency may
reduce risk of CVD.","Increased risk of cardiovascular disease

Elevated MPO is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and predictive of future risk. Individuals with
elevated MPO levels are more than 2x as likely to experience cardiovascular mortality. MPO levels increase with clinica! severity
and higher levels are correlated with poorer outcomes.

Prediction of CVD and CVD events

Elevated MPO helps predict risk of developing CVD in healthy individuals as well as predict CVD events in those with chest
pain, high risk of MI, and acute coronary syndrome.

Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions

Elevated MPO has been observed in many inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis.

Oxidative stress

Elevated MPO levels are indicative of oxidative stress and related cardiovascular implications. Elevated leveis likely represent
suboptimal antioxidant status which should be addressed as a priority.

Non-HDL Cholesterol,"Non-HDL cholesterol represents the circulating cholesterol not carried by HDL (the protective carrier that collects cholesterol
from tissues and blood vesseis and transports it back to the liver). Elevated Non-HDL Cholesterol is associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease and related events. A low or optimal level of non-HDL cholesterol suggests a reduced

atherosclerosis and biood vessel damage, increasing risk of heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. Non-HDL-C may be
considered an indirect reflection of smal!, dense LDL-C which is considered highly atherogenic.
Measurement of non-HDL-C is a better way of assessing cardiovascular disease risk than looking at total cholesterol or LDL
cholesterol alone. Therefore it is a better predictor of disease and related events, including in those with normal LDL and
triglyceride levels.
Unlike measurement of LDL cholesterol, non-HDL-C is useful in those with high triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dL).",0,129.99,0,3.37,70,99,1.81,2.56,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease

Non-HDL cholesterol was found to be the best of all cardiac measures for predicting risk of coronary artery disease events and
stroke.

Increased small, dense LDL cholesterol

An increase in non-HDL cholesterol may reflect an increase in atherogenic small, dense LDL cholesterol (sdLDL-C). This is the

Omega 3 Index,"The Omega-3 Index measures the percentage of omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) in red
blood cell membranes or in the phospholipid portion of the plasma. It is found to reflect the amount of EPA and DHA in
tissues, including cardiac and gastrointestinal tissues.

Omega-3s are important to maintaining the health of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, endocrine, and nervous systems.
Omega-3 DHA is especially important in vision. In general, omega-3s EPA and DHA help control inflammation, blood pressure,
heart rate, and blood clotting, and they support immune and neurological function.

The Omega-3 Index is considered a valid biomarker for assessing cardiovascular risk (especially sudden cardiac death). It is
also used to assess omega-3 nutrition status and compliance with recommendations for increasing omega-3 intake.

A low Omega-3 Index may be associated with high blood pressure, cardiac disease, inflammation, and infiammation-based
disorders.

Due to genetic and other factors, some individuals may not convert the plant-based omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid into
bioactive long-chain EPA and DHA. These individuals may require pre-formed EPA and DHA from the diet.

Research indicates that supplementation with EPA and DHA can significantiy increase EPA DHA levels in cells and tissues and
reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.","The Omega-3 Index (n-3 index) measures the percentage of long-chain omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
docosahexaenoic (DHA) in red blood cell membranes or in the phospholipid portion of the plasma. It is found to reflect the
amount of EPA and DHA in tissues, including cardiac and gastrointestinal tissues, and is considered a valid biomarker for
assessing cardiovascular risk, especially sudden cardiac death.

The index is also used to assess omega-3 nutrition status and compliance with recommendations for increasing omega-3
intake. Red blood cell measurement is an effective method as it is stable and does not require fasting.

The Omega-3 Index may be evaluated as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), inflammation, brain dysfunction, and
other disorders. It correlates with the EPA DHA content of cardiac tissue, and a decreased Omega-3 index is associated with
an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.

A 2014 literature review found that a mean n-3 index below 8% correlated with increased risk of CVD (n-3 index 7.1%),
myocardial infarction (n-3 index 4.88-6.08%), major depression (n-3 index 2.9%), severe sleep apnea (n-3 index 4%), and
diabetes (n-3 index 3.47%). Interestingly, in Korean populations a higher n-3 index between 8.19-10.55% was found in those
with myocardial and brain infarction, suggesting additional underlying risk factors.

Optimal Omega-3 Index

Contemporary research confirms that a suboptimal Omega-3 Index below 8% correlates with myocardial infarction, sudden
cardiac death, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, major depression, and premature birth.

An Omega-3 Index between 0 and 4% is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, acute coronary syndrome,
cognitive impairment, dementia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, depression, eye disease, and death from all causes.

A 2017 meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies revealed that the risk of fatal coronary heart disease was significantly reduced by
15% for every standard deviation increase in the Omega-3 Index. Dose-response research suggests that increasing EPA and
DHA intake by 1.5 grams per day will increase the index by 4%. Researchers confirm that an index below 4% is a high risk, while
an index above 8% is desirable with ranges from 8-12% observed in clinical research.

Results from the Physician Health Study categorized the association of Omega-3 index with sudden death from cardiac causes
as follows:

High risk Less than 3.45%

45% reduced risk  3.46-4.16%

72% reduced risk 4.17-4.98%

81% reduced risk Greater than 4.98%

An n-3 index greater than 8% is considered a reasonable therapeutic target to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and
inflammatory disorders. An index of 4-8% may be considered an intermediate risk and below 4% may be considered high risk.
In conclusion, researchers state that “a low Omega-3 Index fulfills the current criteria for a novel cardiovascular risk factor.”
Inflammation

Past research reveals a correlation between increased cell membrane omega-3 EPA and substantial inhibition of pro-
inflammatory compounds, leading to decreased use of NSAIDs. Researchers note that many placebo-controlled trials support
the use of fish oil supplementation in chronic inflammatory states such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease,
lupus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and migraine headaches. Increasing dietary omega-3s and reducing omega-6s may help
reduce inflammation in susceptible individuals.

Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are also metabolized into endocannabinoids, compounds with a profound impact on
physiology, including anti-inflammatory effects. Omega-3 endocannabinoids complex with neurotransmitters dopamine and
serotonin, furthering their effects on mood and cognitive function.

Supplementation

Increasing intake of long-chain omega-3 EPA and DHA results in a dose and time-dependent increase of Omega-3 Index, with
maximal effects occurring at eight weeks. Supplementation with 460 mg EPA/380 mg DHA for four weeks, with an increase to
980 mg EPA/760 mg DHA for the next four weeks, resulted in an increase in mean baseline n-3 index from 4.9% to 8.4%.
Researchers also observed a significant decrease in omega-6 metabolites (arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid) in red
blood cells. The Omega-3 Index did decline once supplementation was discontinued but remained significantly elevated above
baseline at 6.6% for the following eight weeks.

Individuals with ultra-high risk of psychosis, a group is known to be deficient in long-chain omega-3s, were found to have an
Omega-3 Index 26.9% lower than healthy controls. Six months of supplementation with fish oil (840 mg EPA, 560 mg DHA) in
the high-risk group increased n-3 index from 3% to 4.12%.

Supplementation with four grams of omega-3 fatty acids (2520 mg DHA, 840 mg EPA) in patients with age-related macular
degeneration significantly increased their Omega-3 Index. The mean baseline n-3 index was 5% and levels rose by an average
of 7.6% during the six-month study. Researchers considered the trial too short to see significant changes in eye function.

Omega-3s and Omega-6s

Omega-3s are important to maintaining the health of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, endocrine, and nervous systems.
Omega-3 DHA is especially important in vision. In general, omega-3s EPA and DHA heip control inflammation, blood pressure,
heart rate, and blood clotting, and they support immune and neurological function.

The balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids has significant effects on cardiovascular health and inflammation. Omega-6
linoleic acid, though essential in the diet, is converted to arachidonic acid which then gives rise to pro-inflammatory
metabolites. Omega-3 alpha linolenic acid, also essential in the diet, is converted to EPA and DHA which are then metabolized
into anti-inflammatory compounds. Therefore, omega-3 fats are especially important for reducing inflammation and risk of
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other inflammatory pathologies.

Research demonstrates that supplementation with EPA and DHA can significantly increase EPA DHA levels in cells and tissues,
with a significant increase in red blood cells, plasma, cheek, and cardiac tissue. Increasing omega-3 intake has been found to
reduce blood pressure, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance; enhance vagal activity; improve myocardial metabolic
efficiency; control inflammation and blood clotting; and may reduce atrial fibrillation. However, an excess of omega-6 fatty
acids in the diet can interfere with the inflammation-resolving and anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 compounds.

Balance is always the key and excess intake of linoleic and arachidonic acid promotes or exacerbates a number of disorders
including myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, bone loss, arthritis, asthma, malignancy, hospital stay, depression, suicide,
disruptive behavior, and reduced work productivity. Nutrition intervention shifting the balance of omega-3s can make a
significant difference in clinical outcomes.

However, to confound things further, not all omega-6s are considered pro-inflammatory. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), found
in the meat and milk of grass-fed ruminant animals, and gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) from borage, black current, and evening
primrose oils may help balance and reduce inflammation those these sources are not as commonly consumed.

Currently, the Western diet is high in processed foods and pro-inflammatory omega-6s and low in omega-3s. This creates an
imbalance that favors the production of inflammatory prostaglandins and cytokines, contributing to the characteristic
pathology of many chronic diseases.

Research suggests that an intake of omega-6s 10 times greater than the recommended level of 0.5% of total energy
contributes to cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders including thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmias,
atherosclerosis, arthritis, asthma, osteoporosis, and even tumor metastases). Ultimately, the omega-6 content of tissues in the
body mimics cardiovascular mortality rates. The production of omega-6 pro-inflammatory compounds can be reduced by
increasing the intake of omega-3s.
Omega-3 intake sufficient to raise the n-3 index above 8% is thought to help protect the heart and brain from the negative
effects of a high omega-6 Western-type diet. Preformed EPA and DHA may be the preferred form of omega-3s in the diet,
especially for individuals unable to adequately convert the plant-based omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid into long-chain omega-
3s. This conversion may be reduced due to metabolic, gender, or genetic factors.

Remember that balance is key to omega success. Researchers suggest returning to an intake of omega-6 to omega-3 closer to
pre-industrialization, i.e. an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 1-4/1 instead of the 16-20/1 ratio characteristic of current Western diets.
Reducing omega-6s from vegetable/grain-based oils and increasing omega-3s from seafood or supplementation should help

OxLDL,"Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a modified form of LDL, which is a type of cholesterol carrier in the bloodstream.
Oxidation of LDL occurs when LDL particles become damaged by reactive oxygen species, leading to structural and functional
changes in the molecule. The presence of oxLDL is considered a hallmark of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds
up inside arteries, leading to cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. Elevated levels of oxLDL in the blood
are associated with an increased risk of these cardiovascular events. Additionally, oxLDL plays a crucial role in the
inflammatory processes within atherosclerotic lesions, promoting the recruitment and activation of immune cells in the arterial
wall. Due to its association with cardiovascular disease, oxLDL has emerged as a potential biomarker for assessing
cardiovascular risk and the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.","Oxidized LDL increases the risk of atherosclerosis and is detectable even before atherosclerosis is identified. It triggers an
immune inflammatory response that leads to plaque and associated cardiovascular disease.

Elevated oxLDL has been associated with abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome,
coronary heart disease risk, elevated uric acid, and oxidative stress, even when LDL cholesterol was not directly associated
with these factors. Smail, dense LDL and LDL bound to glucose (i.e., glycated) are more susceptible to oxidation. A low level of
oxidized LDL suggests a reduced risk of cardiometabotic disease.

Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein causes damage that triggers an immune inflammatory response within the arterial wall.
Responding macrophages engulf oxidized LDL, creating foam cells and initiating the formation of atherosclerotic plaque.

LDL that has not been modified by oxidation does not trigger this atherosclerotic process. LDL that becomes glycated (bound
with glucose) is much more susceptible to oxidation, especially as circulation time is increased as LDL receptors fail to
recognize glycated LDL.

Small, dense LDL is more susceptible to oxidation and glycation and should be a component of all cardiovascular risk
assessments.

Circulating oxLDL was the strongest predictor of coronary heart disease compared to the assessment of conventional
lipoprotein profiles and other traditional risk factors. It is a valuable tool for identifying the risk of cardiovascular disease in
apparently healthy individuals. Oxidized LDL can be deposited in the arterial wall prior to established plaques. Research shows
that assessment of circulating oxLDL can help predict the 10-year progression of subclinical atherosclerosis regardless of
cholesterol content, number, or size of LDL particles.

Elevated oxLDL has been associated with abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertrigtyceridemia, metabolic syndrome, and
coronary heart disease risk, even when LDL cholesterol was not directly associated with these factors.

Serum oxLDL is significantly associated with serum uric acid, a biomarker for oxidative stress. Even exposure to a low dose of
oxidized LDL triggered an immune inflammatory response in both macrophages and mast cells, resulting in the release of
inflammatory mediators, including TNF-alpha and histamine. Researchers postulate that a high-fat diet in allergic individuals
May increase their cardiovascular risk. Levels of oxLDL can be improved by maintaining a healthy diet and healthy weight and
participating in regular exercise. Optimal antioxidant status and dietary intake can help decrease the risk of oxidation as well.",0,60,0,60,0,37,0,37,U/L,U/L,"Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease

Parathyroid Hormone - PTH,"Parathyroid Hormone or PTH is a peptide hormone released by the parathyroid glands that acts to raise blood calcium levels.
It is released when calcium sensors (specialized receptor molecules) on the surface of the parathyroid glands detect low blood
calcium levels in the circulation. The release of PTH is therefore inversely proportional to the calcium levels in the blood. In
addition, high blood magnesium levels promote the release of PTH.","PTH acts to raise blood calcium in three main ways:
© It activates osteoclasts - these are bone cells that resorb (degrade) bone, thus releasing some of the calcium stored in
bone in times of hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) for other functions.
© It promotes the reabsorption of calcium from the urine - PTH stimulates cells of the kidney to reabsorb calcium (and
excrete phosphate) from the urine, reducing the loss of calcium in hypocalcemia.
© It promotes the activation of vitamin D precursors in the kidney - active vitamin D (1.25-cholecalciferol) promotes the
uptake of calcium from digested food in the small intestine. This raises calcium levels when they are low.
As the catcium levels become normal, the rising calcium acts to inhibit further PTH release.
Parathyroid hormone values < 9.0 pg/mL or 0.95 pmol/L generally indicate parathyroid hypo-function and values > 47.0
pg/mL or 5 pmol/L generally indicate parathyroid hyper-function.
If both PTH and calcium levels are normal you can be pretty sure that the body is regulating calcium well.

The Calcium - PTH Relationship

1. If calcium levels are low and PTH levels high. then the parathyroid glands are responding as they should and producing
appropriate amounts of PTH. You should investigate other reasons for a low calcium level e.g. Check vitamin D,
phosphorous, and magnesium levels (intracellular levels are best).

2. If your patient’s calcium levels are low and you check PTH and the levels are normal or low, then the parathyroid is not
responding to the low calcium levels and your patient probably has hypoparathyroidism.

3. If calcium levels are high and PTH levels are high, then your patient's parathyroid glands are producing inappropriate
amounts of PTH. In this case, you may want to refer out for x-rays or other imaging studies to check for the cause and
severity of hyperparathyroidism.

4. If calcium levels are high and you check the PTH levels and they are low, then the parathyroid glands are responding
normally. You will want to check for other causes of high calcium levels (impaired cell membrane health, ovarian
hypofunction, Vitamin D (excess ingestion), adrenal hypofunction, hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, neoplasm,
epilepsy, osteoporosis)",10,65,1.06,6.9,10,32,1.06,3.4,pg/mL,pmol/L,"Parathyroid Hypofunction

Phosphorus,"Phosphorous levels, like calcium, are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). Phosphate levels are closely tied with calcium,
but they are not as strictly controlled as calcium. Plasma levels may be decreased after a high carbohydrate meal or in people
with a diet high in refined carbohydrates. Serum phosphorous is a general marker for digestion. Decreased phosphorous levels
are associated with hypochlorhydria. Serum levels of phosphorous may be increased with a high phosphate consumption in
the diet, and with parathyroid hypofunction and renal insufficiency.","The majority (85%) of the body’s phosphorous is stored, in combination with calcium, in the bone. The remainder of the
phosphorous is within the cells. Phosphorous in the blood exists as primarily inorganic phosphate in the form of HPO42- or
H2P04-, with the majority in the HPO42- form, or as phosphate esters. It is difficult to determine the exact ratio between the
two ionic forms of phosphorous, which is expressed as the total quantity of phosphorous.

Phosphorous is essential for bone matrix and hydroxyappetite metabolism. Phosphates play an important role in phospholipid
and nucleic acid formation. It functions in the metabolism of glucose and lipids, is an important part of acid-base regulation
and the storage and transfer of energy in the form of Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate.

Produced by the parathyroid gland, PTH is a very important hormone in phosphorous regulation. PTH promotes

bone resorption of phosphorous, it has a very strong effect on the kidney causing excessive renal phosphate excretion, and
enhances the absorption of phosphorous from the intestine through its effect on vitamin D. The net effect of PTH is to
decrease serum phosphorous.

On the cellular level, phosphate crosses the cell membrane with glucose. Plasma levels may be decreased after a high
carbohydrate meal.

Phosphorous levels should always be evaluated in relation to calcium because of the inverse relationship that exists between
the two minerals. Phosphorous levels will be increased when calcium levels are decreased. When calcium levels increase,
phosphorous levels will decrease. An excess in one of the minerals will cause an increase in renal excretion of the other.

Phosphorus is often assumed to be a calcium antagonist. This may be true in its supplemental form but organic phosphorous
from whole and unrefined foods is naturally buffered with minerals and vitamins that act as synergistic co-factors to increase
calcium metabolism.
Common subjective indications of phosphorous need are:

e Joint stiffness upon arising

e Cold hands and feet

e Joint soreness/stiffness after inactivity (sitting for over 30 minutes) that is improved with movement.",2.5,4.5,0.81,1.45,2.6,3.5,0.84,1.13,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Parathyroid Hyperfunction

Parathyroid hyperfunction will cause an increase in PTH levels, which can lead to a decreased serum phosphorous. If the serum
phosphorous is decreased and the calcium is significantly increasedparathyroid hyperfunction is possible. Alkaline
phosphatase levels may also be increased, along with a normal or decreased serum or RBC magnesium. Follow up with a
serum parathyroid hormone test. If parathyroid hormone levels are also increased presume clinical hyperparathyroidism exists.
Hyperparathyroidism may be due to space-occupying lesions on one or more of the glands. Surgical removal may be
necessary to determine if there is a neoplasm. A patient with increased serum calcium and an increased PTH should be
checked by an endocrinologist, as hyperparathyroidism is a serious condition.

Hypochlorhydria

A decreased serum phosphorous is associated with a decreased production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach
(hypochtorhydria). Hypochlorhydria is possible with a decreased serum phosphorous and an increased globulin level and a
normal or decreased total protein. If the BUN is also increased, hypochiorhydria is highly probable.

Other values that may be reflective of a developing or chronic hypochlorhydria include increased or decreased gastrin, an
increased MCV and MCH , a decreased or normal calcium and iron, a decreased chloride, and a decreased alkaline
phosphatase.

Hyperinsulinism

Phosphate crosses the cell membrane with glucose. Hyperinsulinism, therefore, will cause an increased uptake of glucose by
the cells and will also increase phosphorous uptake, possibly contributing to a decreased serum phosphorous level.

Diet- high in refined carbohydrates

Phosphate crosses the cell membrane with glucose. Plasma levels may be decreased after a meal high in refined
carbohydrates. A diet high in refined carbohydrates and sugars will deplete phosphorous stores and other important co-
factors for carbohydrate metabolism.","Parathyroid Hypofunction

Parathyroid hypofunction will lead to decreased PTH levels that can cause increase serum phosphorous. If phosphorous is
increased along with decreased calcium, parathyroid hypofunction is possible. Alkaline phosphatase levels may also be normal
or decreased.

Follow up with a serum parathyroid hormone test. If parathyroid hormone levels are also decreased presume clinical
hypoparathyroidism exists.

Bone Growth (Children) And Bone Repair (Fractures)

An increased phosphorous is a normal finding in times of increased bone growth and bone repair. Serum phosphorous will
often be elevated with children up to 18 years of age due to increased bone growth. Similar increases may be seen during bone
repair (fractures).

Diet- excessive phosphate consumption

Serum phosphorous levels may be increased in people who drink a lot of soda pop. Phosphoric acid is a common additive in
sodas and can lead to excessive levels of ingested phosphorous that can cause significant problems with the
calcium/phosphorous ratio, leading to decreased serum calcium.

Renal Insufficiency

An increased phosphorous level can be a sign of renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency is an often over-looked condition.
Suspect renal insufficiency if there is an increased serum phosphorous, an increased BUN level with a normal or increased
serum creatinine and a normal to increased uric acid. LDH and AST will usually be normal.","© Ovarian hypofunction

A hemorrhagic disease that is often triggered by a viral disease in children and has symptoms of purpura, increased platetet
destruction, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. This is not something that you are likely to see in general
practice.

Heavy metals
Blood platelets may be low when the body is dealing with an increased heavy metal load. Check for decreased MCH, MCHC,
and LDH Isoenzyme #5. If either is decreased, along with a decreased platelet count, suspect a heavy metal body burden and
consider hair analysis or toxic element testing via blood or urine.

Oxidative Stress and Free Radical Activity
Suspect excess free radical activity and oxidative stress if the platelet level is decreased. If the platelet level is decreased along
with a total cholesterol level that is suddenly below its historical and a decreased lymphocyte count, a decreased albumin, and
an increased total globulin and uric acid level, free radical pathology, increases the risk of developing a neoplasm, should be
investigated.

Purpura and petechiae
The platelet count may be low in these conditions. People who bruise easily often have low vascular and capillary integrity. A
low platelet count can exacerbate such a condition.","Atherosclerosis

Platelet count may be high due to the platelet involvement in the plaque formation. People with atherosclerosis and
atherosclerosis are often told they have “thick” blood and are advised by their medical doctors to take a baby aspirin to “thin”
the blood. Atherosclerosis is probable if the platelet is increased along with an increased uric acid level, an increased
triglyceride in relation to total cholesterol, a decreased HDL, and an increased LDL. C-reactive protein may also be elevated
along with elevated homocysteine and elevated fibrinogen.","e Neoplasm (especially leukemia)

Potassium,"Potassium is one of the main electrolytes in the body. Due to the critical functions of potassium for human metabolism and
physiology, it is essential for the body to maintain optimal serum levels even though a small concentration is found outside of
the cell. Potassium levels should always be viewed in relation to the other electrolytes. Potassium concentration is greatly
influenced by adrenal hormones. As such, potassium levels can be a marker for adrenal dysfunction.","Potassium is the main intracellular cation and acts as the primary intracetlular pH buffer. The majority of potassium (90%) is
found inside the cell, with only small amounts found in other tissues, such as bone and blood. Intracellular potassium
concentration can be as much as 15 to 20 times greater than the serum/plasma.

Potassium plays an essential role in nerve conduction, the maintenance of osmotic pressure, muscle function, cellular transport
via the sodium-potassium pump, and acid-base balance. Potassium, along with calcium and magnesium, controls the rate and
force of cardiac muscle contraction and thus controls the cardiac output.

Potassium, along with sodium, plays an important role in the kidney’s regulation of pH. Potassium bicarbonate is the major
intracellular inorganic buffer. When the body is deficient in potassium, intracellular acidosis occurs. The body responds by
acting on the respiratory center to increase the respiration rate and depth of breathing. This increases carbon dioxide
excretion and brings the body back into pH balance.

Potassium excretion is controlled primarily by the kidney. Between 80 - 90% of cellular potassium is excreted from the

kidney in the urine, the remainder is excreted in the sweat and stool. The kidney does not conserve potassium and will
continue to excrete potassium, even when an adequate amount of potassium is not consumed. Thus, potassium deficiency can
occur if adequate amounts of potassium are not consumed on a daily basis. As the chief cation found in the intracellular fluid,
potassium levels will increase with cellular damage, which causes the potassium to leach into the extracellular fluid.
Aldosterone, which is the main adrenal hormone regulator for potassium levels in the body, causes increased excretion of
potassium from the urine. As such, potassium levets can be a marker for adrenal dysfunction.

Common subjective indications of potassium need are:
1. Muscle weakness
2. Fatigue
3. Mental confusion
4. Heart disturbances
5. Problems in nerve conduction",3.5,5.3,3.5,5.3,4,5,4,5,mEq/L,mmol/L,"Adrenal Stress
Adrenal stress causes an increase in the secretions of both the glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. An increase in
aldosterone, the major mineralcorticoid, from adrenal hyperfunction has an impact on potassium metabolism. Increased
aldosterone levels will cause an increase in the amount of renal potassium excretion, which will cause a decrease in serum
potassium. If the potassium levels are decreased along with a normal or increased sodium, and/or chloride, adrenal stress is
possible. The sodium:potassium ratio will also be increased. Other values that may be out of balance include increased
aldosterone and cortisol levels. if the cortisol level is significantly elevated, rule out adrenal adenoma. Urinary chloride will be
decreased. Adrenal stress can be confirmed with salivary cortisol studies.

Drug Diuretics
Many of the diuretic drugs are potassium sparing. Even so, serum potassium can be decreased with the use of these drugs. In
these cases the BUN and creatinine will frequently be increased, indicating renal insufficiency, and sodium will be decreased.
On the other hand, it is important to not presume that a patient needs potassium because they are on a drug diuretic.
Prolonged diuretic use may also deplete thiamine.

Benign Essential Hypertension
Benign Essentiat Hypertension is common with decreased potassium, even when cortisol, renin and other indicators may be
normal. Generally, increased potassium suggests a congestive heart problem, and decreased potassium suggests a fatigued
heart muscle. HTN has many potential causes and should be investigated with other methodologies beyond blood chemistries.","Adrenal Fatigue and Adrenal Insufficiency
Adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency causes a decrease in the secretions of both the glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid
hormones. A decrease in aldosterone, the major mineralcorticoid, from adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency has an impact
on potassium metabolism. Decreased aldosterone levels will cause a decrease in the amount of renal potassium excretion,
which will cause an increase in serum potassium. If the potassium levels are increased along with a normal or decreased
sodium and/or chloride, adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency is possible. The sodium:potassium ratio will also be
decreased. Other values that may be out of balance include decreased aldosterone and cortisol levels. Urinary chioride will be
increased. Adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency can be confirmed with salivary cortisol studies.

Dehydration
If potassium is increased suspect dehydration. Dehydration is a very common problem and should be factored into your blood
chemistry and CBC analysis. Suspect a short-term (acute) dehydration if there is an increased HGB and/or HCT along with an
increased RBC count. A relative increase in sodium and potassium can be noted as well. Suspect a long-term (chronic)
dehydration if any of the above findings are accompanied by an increased albumin, BUN, and/or serum protein.

Tissue destruction
Potassium is an intracellular ion. An increase in tissue destruction can cause an increase in serum potassium levels as the
potassium is leached out of the damaged cells. LDH levels may also be elevated. Follow-up suspected tissue destruction with
serum protein and LDH isoenzyme electrophoresis, which can help pin point the specific tissue that is being affected.

Metabolic Acidosis
Metabolic acidosis will drive potassium out of the cell, thus causing an increase in serum potassium.","© Anemia (many types)

Prealbumin,"Prealbumin, also called transthyretin, is a protein synthesized primarily by the liver. Untike albumin, which has a longer half-life
(approximately 21 days). prealbumin has a relatively short half-life of around 2 to 3 days, making it a sensitive marker for acute
changes in protein-energy status. Prealbumin functions in the transport of thyroid hormones (T4 and, to a lesser extent, T3)
and also carries retinol-binding protein (RBP) bound to vitamin A. Because of its rapid turnover, prealbumin responds quickly
to variations in nutrient intake or metabolic stress, which is why it is often used in nutritional assessments.","A decline in preatbumin levels can occur within days if a patient is not consuming adequate protein or total calories.
Conversely, levels can rebound quickly when nutritional support is improved. Other factors—like chronic illness, infection, and
inflammation—may confound the interpretation of prealbumin by increasing its breakdown or reducing its hepatic synthesis.
Being produced in the liver, prealbumin levels can drop when hepatocellular function is compromised (e.g., in cirrhosis or
severe hepatitis). Mild elevations of prealbumin alone are seldom indicative of liver disease but may merit correlation with
other liver function tests.

In nephrotic syndrome or other kidney disorders with proteinuria, prealbumin can be lost in the urine. This makes the
interpretation of low levels more complex if renal disease is also present. Conversely, in some cases of renal failure without
significant proteinuria, prealbumin might remain within normal or slightly elevated ranges, requiring context from additional
lab values (e.g., BUN/creatinine) to draw accurate conclusions.

As a negative acute-phase reactant, prealbumin levels may fall in the presence of systemic inflammation or infection.
Laboratory correlation with inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) and clinical assessment is important to distinguish between low
levels due to malnutrition versus those due to an acute inflammatory or infectious process.

Note: Always interpret prealbumin in the context of clinical findings, dietary history, and other laboratory values (e.g., CRP.
albumin, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests). Its short half-life makes it uniquely useful for tracking rapid changes in
nutritional status, but it can also fluctuate with inflammation, renal pathology, and certain medications.",17,34,17,340,17,34,170,340,mg/dL,g/L,"Malnutrition / Protein Deficiency

Progesterone - Female,"Progesterone, a vital female hormone, is mainly produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary following ovulation and, to a
lesser extent, by the adrenal glands and the placenta during pregnancy. Its fundamental role is to regulate the menstrual cycle
by preparing the endometrial lining for a potential pregnancy and supporting the early stages of pregnancy. If conception
doesn't happen, a decline in progesterone leads to menstruation. For women of reproductive age, low progesterone levels can
suggest anovulation, which means no egg was released, possibly due to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or
hypothalamic amenorrhea. It may also indicate challenges like early pregnancy loss or difficulty maintaining a pregnancy, and
symptoms such as irregular cycles, severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS), or mid-cycle spotting. On the other hand, high
progesterone levels are typically seen post-ovulation or in early pregnancy. Persistently elevated levels might be linked to
issues like ovarian cysts or adrenal disorders. For postmenopausal women, a decline in progesterone is expected due to
ceased ovulation, while elevated levels are unusual and could require further exploration.","The progesterone concentration correlates with the development and regression of the corpus luteum. Whereas progesterone
is barely detectable in the follicular phase of the female cycle, a rise in the progesterone level is observed one day prior to
ovulation. Increased progesterone synthesis occurs during the luteat phase.

Progesterone brings about the conversion of the uterine mucosa into a tissue rich in glands (secretion phase), in order to
prepare for the intrauterine implantation of the fertilized ovum. During pregnancy, progesterone inhibits the contraction of the
myometrium. In the mammary gland, progesterone (together with estrogens) promotes the proliferation and secretion
disposition of the alveoli.",0,1,0,3.18,2.6,21.5,8.27,68.37,ng/mL,nmol/L,"Short Luteal Phase Syndrome
Low serum progesterone may be an indication of Short Luteal Phase Syndrome, which may indicate a disruption in a woman’s
menstrual cycle. Short Luteal Phase Syndrome can be associated with hyperestrogenism and estrogen dominance. It’s
important to remember that serum progesterone testing is a spot test, ie. you do not know what day of the cycle you're doing
the test on. As such a low progesterone test may be due to a natural low point in progesterone output or conditions such as
Short Luteal Phase Syndrome. Suspicion of Short Luteal Phase Syndrome goes up with low serum progesterone below 0.2
ng/ml or 0.64 nmol/L and elevated serum estradiol above 352 pg/ml or 1292.2 pmol/L. Our recommendation, if you see low
serum progesterone and suspect Short Luteal Phase Syndrome, is to order a full 30-day salivary hormone check for estrogens

Progesterone - Male,"Progesterone is often considered to be a female hormone but men produce progesterone too. In the body, it’s converted into
testosterone and serves to oppose and balance estrogen. As men age, their progesterone levels drop, which may cause the
testosterone levels to fall.","Progesterone in the male balances and opposes unopposed estrogen. Unfortunately, as men age, the unopposed estrogen
levels tend to rise but there is no increase in progesterone so we get an imbalance in the progesterone:estrogen ratio.

contributing factor for low progesterone in males. Progesterone in males plays a calming role in the nervous system and
activates the GABA chloride channel to help the body shut down physically and mentally for sleep, rest and recovery. It may
be helpful to induce restful sleep.

For men, progesterone is a hormone that opposes the “feminization” effects of too much estrogen. It also is a powerful
inhibitor of 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme that converts healthy testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Increased levels
of DHT are associated with male-pattern baldness and prostate disease.

actions and has an effect on other hormones.
Prolactin release is primarily under the control of the hypothalamus. The two hypothalamic hormones involved in prolactin
regulation are thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) and dopamine. The predominant hormone in the regulation is the
inhibitory neurotransmitter dopamine. The hypothalamus receives afferent sensory nerve cell input primarily from the nipples
of lactating women.
This feedback loop increases lactation during suckling by inhibiting dopamine release and stimulating TRH release.

PSA is currently used as a biological marker or tumor marker that can be used to detect disease related to the prostate.
Increased levels can indicate prostate cancer or less serious conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostatitis.
It’s important to remember that elevated levels of PSA may not necessarily signal prostate cancer, and prostate cancer may
not always be accompanied by expression of PSA.",0,4,0,4,0,2,0,2,ng/mL,ug/L,,"Elevated levels of PSA - Total are associated with the following conditions:

Expanding PSA Readings
It is unwise in medicine to rely on one method of evaluation and | recommend that you look at a number of other assessment
modalities to increase your accuracy in the assessment of prostate health. PSA levels alone tell us something, but far more
information is available if we look beyond the static measurement to the interrelationships between levels over time. |
recommend that you use the following in a comprehensive risk assessment for your patients.
PSA Velocity (PSAV)
PSAV is based on changes in PSA over time. It seems that the rate of increase in PSA is actually more important as a predictor
of mortality than the PSA reading itself. A sharp rise in the PSA level raises the suspicion of cancer. In a study published in the
New England Journal of Medicine men who showed a 2.0 ng/ml or greater increase in PSA from the previous year’s reading
were 10 times more likely to die within seven years. In my opinion, men over thirty five should get a baseline PSA test, and then
test annually to measure the level of increase (PSA velocity).

PSA Doubling Time (PSADT)

PSADT looks at the amount of time it takes for the PSA level to double and is a reflection of tumor growth. For instance, the
average PSADT for prostate cancer is 48 months. Men with optimal prostate health have no appreciable rise in PSA. It is a
cause for concern if the PSA level doubles in less than 12 years.

PSA Density (PSAD)

PSAD considers the relationship of the PSA level to the size of the prostate and is helpful in diagnosing prostate cancer. The
size of the prostate can be determined by radiological or ultrasound evaluation. PSAD is calculated by dividing the PSA result
Cin nanograms/ml) by an accurate determination of prostate gland volume. PSAD resuits above 0.15 ng/cc are associated with
a diagnosis of prostate cancer.",,,"©  Increased in PSA - Total can occur

RDW,"Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) quantifies the degree of size variation (anisocytosis) among red blood cells in a given
blood sample. Expressed as a percentage, RDW complements indices such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) to characterize
different types of anemia or other hematologic conditions. While an elevated RDW frequently indicates a mix of smaller and
larger RBCs—often in deficiency anemias—there is no widely recognized clinical condition specifically linked to a decreased
ROW.","It’s important to remember that RDW is not really a helpful test for those who do not have anemia. It is helpful in the
investigation of hematological disorders and monitoring therapy.",11%,15%,11%,15%,11%,12.60%,11%,12.60%,,,"Uniform RBC Size
Typically reflects a consistent RBC population and is not generally indicative of disease. It should be interpreted with other

Lack of Established Pathology
No well-defined conditions are directly linked to decreased RDW, which is often considered a normal finding if other
hematologic markers are within reference ranges.","Nutrient Deficiency Anemias

Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Notably elevates RDW due to macrocytosis; older RBCs and newer, larger RBCs differ significantly in

Mixed Anemias: Combination of microcytic and macrocytic RBCs (e.g., coexisting iron and B12 deficiencies) can markedly
increase RDW.

Reticulocyte - %,"A reticulocyte is a young, immature red blood cell. An increased reticulocyte % indicates that increased production of red
blood cells is occurring in the bone marrow in response to premature destruction or loss.","A reticulocyte is non-nucleated, yet contains RNA that stains a gray-blue color when stained with brilliant Cresyl blue. A red
blood cell is a reticulocyte for the first 1-2 days after being released into general circulation, and before it reaches its fully

also be seen in untreated pernicious anemia.","Presence of an occult or unknown disease e.g. microscopic internal bleeding or hemolysis
The presence of reticulocytes can lead to the recognition of an otherwise unknown or unrecognized illness e.g. a chronic
Microscopic bleed or unrecognized hemolysis (sickle cell disease or thalassemia). The probability that there is a microscopic
bleed somewhere in the body increases as the reticulocyte % increases. Expect to see an increased reticulocyte % with a

Reverse T3,"Reverse T-3 is formed from the thyroid hormone T-4 (thyroxine). it is thought to be an inactive form of thyroid hormone that
acts as a sort of metabolic brake on the body. High stress and cortisol levels, chronic illness, inflammation, multiple vitamin
deficiencies, fasting, yo-yo dieting. poor nutrition, calorie restriction, lack of exercise, and increased alcohol intake can all raise
reverse T-3 levels.","T4, under certain conditions, can be converted into a molecule of reverse T3 (rT3) in the peripheral tissues. Small amounts of
rT3 are made within the thyroid; however, 95% of rT3 is produced from peripheral conversion of T4. The enzyme responsible
for this conversion is 5-deiodinase and is not believed to be dependent on selenium. lodine is removed by this enzyme from
the 5 location on the second tyrosyl residue.

Under normal conditions, 45 - 50% of the daily production of T4 is transformed into rT3. Reverse T3 can be seen as a sort of
“blocker molecule” that fits in and occupies the T3 receptors on the cell membrane. It does not permit T3 to enter and increase
energy production. It acts as a metabolic brake to slow down ATP synthesis within the cell. Current research also suggests
that rT3 inhibits 5’-deiodinase, suggesting it might interfere with peripheral conversion of T4 into T3. The production of rT3 is

sdLDL-C,"Although cholesterol is important to many structural and metabolic functions in the body, it can increase the risk of
atherosclerosis and heart disease when carried on small dense lipoprotein carriers called sdLDL. The sdLDL-cholesterol
(sdLDL-C) is highly susceptible to oxidation and other changes that make it much more likely to cause atherosclerosis and
heart disease. Elevated levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and even subclinical
hypothyroidism. Low levels of sdLDL-C are likely associated with a reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease","Small low-density lipoproteins are considered highly atherogenic due to their increased susceptibility to oxidation, glycation,
and other detrimental modifications, as well as their inadequate levels of protective antioxidants. These smaller modified LDL
particles can more easily penetrate the artery wall and contribute to atherosclerosis and plaque development (Ivanova 2017).
Systemic review and meta-analysis of 21 studies comprising 30,6028 individuals revealed an association of sdLDL-C with
coronary heart disease that was independent of conventional CVD risk factors as well as other tipid subfractions. Results
suggest that a dose-dependent relationship may be present. The smallest study noted that risk increased with sdLDL-C above
15.9 mg/dL (0.41 mmol/L), the second largest study saw risk increase above 19.8 mg/dL ¢0.51 mmol/L), and the largest study
found risk increase above 35.8 mg/dL (0.93 mmol/L) though that first quartile was not further broken down for values below
35.8 mg/dL. The meta-analysis also noted that genetic factors, specifically single nucleotide polymorphisms, influence sdLDL-
C levels (Liou 2020). Individuals in the highest quartile of this study, 45.4-51.2 mg/dL (1.18-133 mmol/L), tended to have a
higher BMI and hs-CRP, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes with levels being significantly higher in diabetics than
non-diabetics (Hoogeveen 2014).

A 16-year follow-up of individuals initially free from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) found that sdLDL-C was
the most atherogenic lipoprotein and most significant lipid parameter that can be used to evaluate risk. Individuals who
developed ASCVD maintained a median sdLDL-C of 50.7 mg/dL (1.31 mmol/L) while those still free of ASCVD maintained a
median sdLDL-C of 41.7 mg/dL (1.08 mmol/L) (lzeki 2021).

Elevated sdLDL-C is associated with dyslipidemia, inflammation, and obesity, factors that in turn are associated with metabolic
syndrome. One cross-sectional study of 1065 Chinese males undergoing health screening found that sdLDL-C was significantly
higher in those diagnosed with metabolic syndrome versus those without, i.e., 47.5 mg/dL (1.23 mmol/L) versus 36.3 mg/dL
(0.95 mmol/L). Researchers note that higher sdLDL-C is associated with metabolic syndrome independent of inflammation
and central obesity. The ratio of sdLDL-C to LDL-C was higher in metabolic syndrome as well, i.e., 34.79 versus 25.91. (Fan
2019),

A higher sdLDL-C was also significantly associated with metabolic syndrome in a study of 214 outpatients with at least one
risk factor for CVD, but without unstable angina or history of MI or CHF. Not only was higher sdLDL-C found to be associated
with metabolic syndrome, i.e., 35.1 mg/dL (0.91 mmol/L) versus 28.5 mg/dL (0.74 mmol/L), but the ratio of sdLDL-C to LDL-C
was also significantly higher with metabolic syndrome at 0.36 versus 0.32 without. A higher ratio was associated significantly
with increasing HbAic and decreasing HDL-C as well. Adiponectin was significantly lower, i.e., 6.8 ug/mL versus 9.3 ug/mL, in
those with metabolic syndrome and elevated sdLDL-C and sdLDL-C:LDL-C as well. Weight loss, exercise, and diet
improvements resulted in significantly decreased sd-LDL-C:LDL-C ratios and increased adiponectin over a 1-year period (Satoh
2008).

Subclinical hypothyroidism has also been associated with high sdLDL-C as observed in a clinical study of 100 women aged 21-
75 years. Those diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly higher sdLDL-C than euthyroid subjects. Elevated
sdLDL-C was defined as above 42.08 mg/dL (1.099 mmol/L) in those aged 21-54 and 48.6 mg/dL (1.259 mmol/L) in those
aged 55-75 (Saric 2017).

Elevated sdLDL-cholesterol is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (lzeki 2021), inflammation, obesity,
metabolic syndrome (Fan 2019, Hoogeveen 2014), low adiponectin (Satoh 2008), diabetes (Hoogeveen 2014), subclinical
hypothyroidism (Saric 2017), and genetic factors (Liou 2020).

SDMA,"SDMA (Symmetric Dimethylarginine) is a lesser-known but significant biomarker, particularly in the context of kidney health
and cardiovascular disease. SMDA is a metabolite of L-arginine that interferes with nitric oxide production by reducing the
cellular availability of arginine. The subsequent deficiency of nitric oxide contributes to endothelial dysfunction and increased
risk of cardiometabolic disease.","An elevated SDMA represents reduced renal function and clearance, reflected by a decreased estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR). Elevated SDMA is also considered a risk factor for CVD.",73,135,0.36,0.68,0,135,0,0.68,ng/mL,umol/L,"Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction
Low/optimal levels of SDMA indicate a reduced risk of disease related to elevated SDMA. Comprehensive testing should be

When elevated along with ADMA levels, SDMA increases represent an increased risk of endothelial dysfunction and
cardiovascular disease. When elevated without elevated ADMA, SDMA increases reflect renal dysfunction.

Renal dysfunction

Elevated SDMA levels positively correlate with reduced renal function as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR). SDMA is also involved in activating inflammatory compounds and promoting inflammation in chronic kidney disease.
Insulin resistance, diabetes, and pre-diabetes.

Elevated levels of both SDMA and ADMA are one of the earliest signs of insulin resistance, the root cause of both type 2

Selenium - RBC,"Selenium is an essential nutrient that plays an important role in antioxidant activity, thyroid hormone metabolism, inflammation
control, and immune and reproductive system regulation. Elevated serum selenium levels are a sign of excess selenium
exposure. Decreased serum selenium levels are a sign of selenium deficiency. Low levels of selenium in the blood may be due
to dietary insufficiency, especially in areas where the soil is deficient in selenium.","Selenium is incorporated into special proteins called selenoproteins. These include glutathione peroxidase, a family of
antioxidant enzymes that protects cell membranes and lipids from oxidation. For example, selenium protects LDL cholesterol
from oxidation, a major contributor to atherosclerosis.

Oxidative damage contributes to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer. Cardiac
tissue is especially sensitive to selenium availability and deficiency will lead to cardiac dysfunction.

Selenium levels in the blood correlate with glutathione peroxidase activity and reflect tissue stores of selenium. The
Measurement may be categorized as serum/plasma, whole blood, or red blood cell. Approximately 75% of selenium in whole
blood is found in the plasma/serum component. Selenium intake of ~ 50 ug/L (RDA) roughly corresponds to plasma selenium
of -100 ug/L.

Dietary selenium comes primarily from plant foods that depend upon the selenium content of the soil. The soil in the
midwestern states of Nebraska and North and South Dakota in the USA is rich in selenium while southeast coastal area soil is
very low and is associated with selenium insufficiency. Meat and seafood are sources of dietary selenium as well. Selenium
supplementation can help address insufficiencies but must be done carefully to avoid toxicity.

Elevated levels of selenium

Elevated levels of selenium may indicate toxicity. Toxic levels may be due to exposure from industrial sources or contaminated
drinking water. Industrial sources include copper refining, electronic semiconductors, decotorization, and rubber vulcanization.
Excessive supplementation can cause selenium toxicity as well.

Symptoms of toxicity include nervous system abnormalities; fatigue; red swollen skin (hands, feet); joint pain; dry brittle hair
and fingernails; nail discoloration; hair loss; diarrhea; nausea; and an odor of garlic on the breath.

Low levels of selenium

Low levels of selenium in the blood may be due to dietary insufficiency, especially in areas where the soil is deficient;
parenteral nutrition without selenium for longer than one week; genetic factors; and general malnutrition.

Selenium deficiency may manifest as cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure; increased risk of stroke mortality; immune
insufficiency; and chronic conditions such as kidney disease, heart disease, and cancer. Even marginal deficits in selenium may
be associated with age-related decline in brain function.

Symptoms of deficiency may include painful weak muscles and depigmentation of skin and hair. Erythrocyte macrocytosis and
elevated levels of transaminase and creatine kinase may be present as well.",120,300,120,300,135,255,135,255,ug/L,ug/L,"Selenium Deficiency

Low levels of selenium in the blood are a sign of selenium deficiency. This may be due to dietary insufficiency, especially in
areas where the soil is deficient; parenteral nutrition without selenium for longer than one week; genetic factors; and genera!
malnutrition.

Atherosclerosis

Selenium deficiency impairs antioxidant systems that protect lipids such as LDL cholesterol from becoming oxidized and
atherogenic.

Cardiac dysfunction

Selenium deficiency contributes to cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and atherosclerotic disease.

Cell membrane damage, hemolytic anemia

Selenium deficiency leads to a reduction in protective antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases that protect cell
membranes from oxidative damage. Related damage to red blood ce!l membranes will contribute to hemolytic anemia.
Chronic disease

Low selenium contributes to oxidative damage which is implicated in chronic diseases such as kidney disease, heart disease,
cancer, and dementia.

Heavy Metal Toxicity

Selenium protects cells from heavy metals, including mercury and lead, and may prevent associated neurotoxicity and
dysfunction. Heavy metal toxicity is associated with low red blood selenium, even when serum levels are not decreased.","Selenium Toxicity

Elevated levels of serum selenium are most often due to excess selenium supplementation or toxicity from industrial exposure.

Selenium - Serum,"Selenium is an essential nutrient that plays an important role in antioxidant activity, thyroid hormone metabolism, inflammation
control, and immune and reproductive system regulation. Elevated serum selenium levels are a sign of excess selenium
exposure. Decreased serum selenium levels are a sign of selenium deficiency. Low levels of selenium in the blood may be due
to dietary insufficiency, especially in areas where the soil is deficient in selenium.","Selenium is incorporated into special proteins called selenoproteins. These include glutathione peroxidase, a family of
antioxidant enzymes that protects cell membranes and lipids from oxidation. For example, selenium protects LDL cholesterol
from oxidation, a major contributor to atherosclerosis.

Oxidative damage contributes to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer. Cardiac
tissue is especially sensitive to selenium availability and deficiency will lead to cardiac dysfunction.

Selenium levels in the blood correlate with glutathione peroxidase activity and reflect tissue stores of selenium. The
Measurement may be categorized as serum/plasma, whole blood, or red blood cell. Approximately 75% of selenium in whole
blood is found in the plasma/serum component. Selenium intake of ~ 50 ug/L (RDA) roughly corresponds to plasma selenium
of -100 ug/L.

Dietary selenium comes primarily from plant foods that depend upon the selenium content of the soil. The soil in the
midwestern states of Nebraska and North and South Dakota in the USA is rich in selenium while southeast coastal area soil is
very low and is associated with selenium insufficiency. Meat and seafood are sources of dietary selenium as well. Selenium
supplementation can help address insufficiencies but must be done carefully to avoid toxicity.

Elevated levels of selenium

Elevated levels of selenium may indicate toxicity. Toxic levels may be due to exposure from industrial sources or contaminated
drinking water. Industrial sources include copper refining, electronic semiconductors, decolorization, and rubber vulcanization.
Excessive supplementation can cause selenium toxicity as well.

Symptoms of toxicity include nervous system abnormalities; fatigue; red swollen skin (hands, feet); joint pain; dry brittle hair
and fingernails; nail discoloration; hair loss; diarrhea; nausea; and an odor of garlic on the breath.

Low levels of selenium

Low levels of selenium in the blood may be due to dietary insufficiency, especially in areas where the soil is deficient;
parenteral nutrition without selenium for longer than one week; genetic factors; and general malnutrition.

Selenium deficiency may manifest as cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure; increased risk of stroke mortality; immune
insufficiency; and chronic conditions such as kidney disease, heart disease, and cancer. Even marginal deficits in selenium may
be associated with age-related decline in brain function.

Symptoms of deficiency may include painful weak muscles and depigmentation of skin and hair. Erythrocyte macrocytosis and
elevated levels of transaminase and creatine kinase may be present as well.c",63,160,0.8,2.03,70,121,0.89,1.54,ug/L,umol/L,"Selenium Deficiency

Small LDL-P (NMR),"Low-density lipoproteins carry cholesterol in the blood but also contain protein, triglycerides, and phospholipids. Their
composition changes as they circulate depending on their relative content of protein and lipids. Small LDL-P is a measurement
of small dense LDL particles, also known as sdLDL, An elevated number of small dense LDL (sdLDL) particles is associated
with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease as well as insulin resistance and diabetes.","Due to its size, sdLDL can easily infiltrate the artery wall and promote inflammation. It contains fewer antioxidant vitamins,
making it more susceptible to oxidation. It is more susceptible to glycation as well, increasing its atherogenicity and
detrimental effects.

Therefore, sdLDL is more apt to cause atherosclerotic plaques and arterial wall damage and contribute more to cardiovascular
disease than large buoyant LDL particles.

Research suggests that an increased number of sdLDL particles increases the risk of myocardial infarction even when total and
LDL cholesterol are not elevated.

The risk of developing coronary plaque and suffering an MI may be tripled due to sdLDL. Smali, dense LDL has been
associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes as well.

A plant-based diet, healthy lifestyle, and weight loss can help increase LDL particle size and reduce sdLDL. Antioxidant intake
and status may play a role in reducing the atherogenic potential of sdLDL as well.

Sodium,"Sodium is an important blood electrolyte and functions to maintain osmotic pressure, acid-base balance, aids in nerve impulse
transmission, as well as renal, cardiac, and adrenal functions. Increased sodium is most often due to dehydration (sweating,
diarrhea, vomiting, polyuria, etc.) or adrenal stress. Decreased sodium levels are associated with adrenal insufficiency and
edema.","Constituting 90% of the electrolyte fluid, sodium is the most prevalent cation in the extra-cellutar fluid.
Sodium is a major part of the sodium-potassium pump, which facilitates cellular transport. Sodium also maintains the acidity of
the urine.
The body has many complex mechanisms for maintaining a constant and steady level of plasma and extracellular sodium.
These complex mechanisms include:

© Renal blood flow

© Carbonic anhydrase enzymatic activity

© Aldosterone

© Renin enzymatic secretion

© Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/ Vasopressin

Serum sodium levels are affected more by changes in fluid balance, body water and functional issues, such as adrenal
dysfunction than by changes in sodium/salt balance. Urinary sodium is a more sensitive indicator of altered sodium/salt
balance than blood.

Sodium levels are ultimately under the influence of adrenal cortex hormones, especially the mineralcorticoid aldosterone,
which causes the body to retain sodium by causing a decreased excretion of sodium from the urine. As such, sodium levels can
be a marker for adrenal dysfunction.",135,146,135,146,137,142,137,142,mEq/L,mmol/L,"Adrenal Fatigue and Insufficiency

Adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency cause a decrease in the secretions of both the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
hormones. A decrease in aldosterone, the major mineralocorticoid, from adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency will impact
sodium metabolism. Decreased aldosterone levels will cause an increase in the amount of renal sodium excretion, which will
cause a decrease in serum sodium. If the sodium levels are decreased along with increased potassium, adrenal! fatigue, and
adrenal insufficiency are possible. The sodium: potassium ratio will also be decreased. Other values that may be out of balance
include decreased chloride, aldosterone, and cortisol levels. Urinary chloride will be increased. Adrenal fatigue and adrenal
insufficiency can be confirmed with salivary cortisol studies.

Addison’s disease

In its pathological state, severe hypoadrenia from Addison’s disease impairs sodium reabsorption and causes excess sodium
excretion due to a lack of both glucocorticoids and mineralcorticoids, especially aldosterone.

Edema

Hyponatremia (a decreased sodium level) is often reflective of a relative excess of body water rather than a low total body
sodium. The following are some of the conditions implicated by this pattern: Congestive heart failure, Hypothyroidism,
Nephritis/ Kidney disease.

Drug Diuretics

Drug diuretics can alter sodium as well as potassium levels in the body. Many of the diuretic drugs are potassium-sparing. Even
so, serum potassium can be decreased with the use of these drugs. In these cases the BUN and creatinine will frequently be
increased, indicating renal insufficiency, and sodium will be decreased. On the other hand, it is important to not presume that a
patient needs potassium because they are on a drug diuretic. Prolonged diuretic use may also deplete Thiamine.","Adrenal Stress

Adrenal stress causes an increase in the secretions of both the glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. An increase in
aldosterone, the major mineralcorticoid, from adrenal stress will have an impact on sodium regulation. Increased aldosterone
levels will cause an increase in sodium resorption from the kidney, which will cause an increase in serum sodium. If the sodium
levels are increased along with a decreased potassium, adrenal stress is possible. The sodium:potassium ratio will also be
increased. Other values that may be out of balance include increased chloride, increased aldosterone and cortisol levels. If the
cortisol level is significantly elevated, rule out adrenal adenoma. Urinary chloride will be decreased. Adrenal stresscan be
confirmed with salivary cortisol studies.

Dehydration

If sodium is increased suspect dehydration. Dehydration is a very common problem and should be factored into your blood
chemistry and CBC analysis. Suspect a short-term (acute) dehydration if there is an increased HGB and/or HCT along with an
increased RBC count. A relative increase in Sodium and Potassium can be noted as well. Suspect a long-term (chronic)
dehydration if any of the above findings are accompanied by an increased Albumin , increased BUN and/or serum Protein.","© Low salt intake (use Celtic or sea salt instead of table salt)

Sodium : Potassium,"The Sodium:Potassium ratio is determined from the serum sodium and serum potassium levels. Both of these elements are
under the influence of the adrenal! glands. An increased Sodium:Potassium ratio is associated with acute stress and a
decreased Sodium:Potassium ratio is associated with chronic stress and adrenal insufficiency.","The sodium and potassium levels are under the influence of aldosterone and cortisol, both hormones produced by the adrenal
glands. Aldosterone causes the body to retain sodium by causing a decreased excretion of sodium from the kidney.
Aldosterone has the opposite effect on potassium causing the body to excrete potassium by increasing the excretion of
potassium from the kidney.",30,35,30,35,30,35,30,35,Ratio,Ratio,"Chronic Stress, Adrenal Fatigue and Adrenal Insufficiency

A decreased sodium:potassium ratio is an indication of chronic stress, adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency. Chronic stress
weakens the adrenal glands and causes a decrease in adrenal activity and a decrease in aldosterone output. Low aldosterone
causes sodium to be excreted by the body (hence the low serum sodium) and causes the potassium to be retained thus
increasing the serum potassium levels. The net effect is a decreased sodium:potassium ratio.

A catabolism indicator

A decreased sodium:potassium ratio is an indication of a higher cortisol output than aldosterone output. Cortisol is a hormone
associated with tissue breakdown and catabolism. A decreased sodium-potassium ratio is an indication of catabolism, i.e. the
body may be breaking down tissue faster than it is regenerating it.","Acute Stress

An elevated sodium:potassium ratio is an indication of acute stress. Acute stress causes an increase in adrenal activity and an
increase in aldosterone output. Aldosterone causes sodium to be retained in the body and an increase in serum sodium. This
also causes the potassium to be excreted thus lowering the serum potassium levels. The net effect is an increased
sodium:potassium ratio.

An inflammation indicator

An elevated sodium:potassium ratio is an indication of a higher aldosterone output. Aldosterone is often considered a pro-
inflammatory hormone and cortisol is an anti-inflammatory hormone so an increase in aldosterone, as seen in a high
sodium:potassium ratio is seen as an inflammatory indicator associated with inflammation and pain.","O Asodium:potassium ratio <30 Kidney stress, Liver stress

the blood. Free T-3 levels may be elevated with hyperthyroidism and decreased with hypothyroidism.","T-3 exists in two forms in the serum. The majority of T-3 is bound to protein and approximately 8-10% of the total T-3 is
unbound. Unbound T-3 is known as Free T-3. Although some T-3 is produced in the thyroid, approximatety 80 - 85% is

Thyroid Conversion Syndrome

Thyroid Conversion Syndrome is similar to a condition called Euthyroid sick syndrome, which is a condition of normal thyroid
gland activity with a reduced peripheral 5’-deiodination conversion of T4 into T3 due to a liver or renal dysfunction or disease.
However, Thyroid Conversion Syndrome is due to many of the conditions that affect the peripheral conversion of T4 into T3
with a rise in reverse T3 levels (stress, malnutrition, low-calorie diets, lack of exercise etc.}. In both cases, there will be an
increase in reverse T3. Consider this condition with normal TSH, low total T3, low free T3, normal total T4, normal free T4, and
an increased reverse T3. With Thyroid Conversion Syndrome we might not see any liver or kidney dysfunction.

Secondary Hypothyroidism (Anterior Pituitary Hypofunction)

Thyroid hypofunction is often secondary to an anterior pituitary hypofunction (Secondary Hypothyroidism). Suspect anterior
pituitary dysfunction if the subjective indications of thyroid hypofunction are present and the following pattern is seen: A
decreased TSH, a normal T-3 uptake, a decreased or normal Total T4, a normal or decreased Free T4 and a normal or
decreased Free T3. The likelihood increases if serum triglycerides are elevated and total cholesterol is increased. Additional
elements that may be out of range with secondary hypothyrodism include an increased BUN above the “normal” range and an
increased calcium. Anterior pituitary hypofunction is a common problem and one that is frequentiy mistaken for thyroid
hypofunction (the subjective indications are usually identical and the patient’s axillary temperature will frequently be below
normal).

Consider Selenium deficiency if the total T3 is reduced, the free T3 is reduced along with a normal TSH and T-4 level. Inactive
T4 is converted into T3, the active thyroid hormone, by cleaving an iodine molecule from its structure. Selenium plays an active
role in this cleaving process.","Hyperthyroidism

Although less common than hypothyroidism, the following pattern may help elucidate a developing or existent hyperthyroid
state. Hyperthyroidism is possible if the TSH is low. The likelihood increases when there is also an increased Total T3, Increased
Free T3, increased T3 uptake, increased FTI and/or Increased T4. Consider running thyroid antibody studies to rule out
Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Grave’s disease. Rule out food allergy/sensitivities, environmental sensitivities, recent

T-3 uptake is dependent on the number of binding sites on the thyroxine-binding protein, any changes in the amount of

production of T4 by the follicles of the thyroid gland. Free T-4 is the unbound form of T4 in the body. Only about 0.03 - 0.05%
of circulating T4 is in the free form. Free T-4 will be elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism.","T-4 is either stored in the follicle of the gland or released from the thyroid into the blood stream primarily bound to thyroxine-
binding globulin (TBG). T4 is either converted to T3 or rT3, or eliminated via conjugation, deamination or decarboxylation in
the liver. It is estimated that about 70% of T4 produced in the thyroid is eventually deiodinated in peripheral tissues into either
T3 or rT3 via the deiodinase enzyme that cleaves an iodine molecule from the quaternary form. T-4 conversion into T-3 is
dependent upon the presence of iodine, selenium, and tyrosine amongst other nutrients. Therefore, these key nutrient
deficiencies should be ruled out before instituting “Normal” thyroid treatment.
Thyroxine or T-4 has wide-ranging metabolic activities in the body:

© Basal Metabolic Rate

© Normal growth and development

© Metabolism of fats and proteins

© Regulation of stress hormones and neurotransmitters

© Immune resistance.
High levels of estrogen (BCPs or pregnancy) will increase the amount of thyroxine-binding globulin that binds to T4. This can
give misleading elevated T4 levels, which looks like hyperthyroidism when it’s not. In these situations measuring free T4 can be
helpful because it will give you a more accurate assessment of thyroid function.",0.8,1.8,10.3,23.17,1,1.5,12.87,19.3,ng/dL,pmol/L,"Primary hypothyroidism

In primary hypothyroidism the problem is located in the thyroid gland itself, which fails to produce thyroid hormone. Primary
hypothyroidism is often preceded by autoimmune thyroid disease. If you have a patient with suspected thyroid disease you
should screen for thyroid antibodies. Primary hypothyroidism will present with an increased TSH and you may see a normal or
decreased total T4 level along woith a possible decrease in total T3, free T4, and/or free T3. You may see a possible increase in
cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels. Note: Hypothyroidism can exist with an increased TSH and a normal Free T-4.

endocrine gland capable of storing the hormone it synthesizes, roughly a 100 days supply, and the early destruction of TPO
causes the stored T4 to be released into the blood stream. This causes the hyperthyroid like symptoms of early Hashimotos.
Quest laboratories and Labcorp use different testing methodologies for this element, hence the different reference ranges for

In the early stages of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies attack the gland itself causing T4 to spill
into the blood stream leading to a short-lived bout of hyperthyroidism. The body reacts to the elevated T4 levels by trying to
lower T4 levels. It does this by lowering the output of TSH from the anterior pituitary. This hypermetabolic effect of increased
T4 levels stresses the adrenals and causes adrenal fatigue. In early stages of Hashimoto’s the TSH will be very low, Total and
Free T4 will be high and Total and Free T3 will be high. Reverse T3 may be elevated. Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies and
Thyroglobulin Antibodies will be elevated.

Late stage Hashimoto's Thyroiditis

Late stage Hashimotos is marked by decreased total and free T4 and gradual hypothyroidism because the auto-antibodies
have already destroyed much of the glandular tissue and there are not many cells left to produce T4. Now there is adrenal
fatigue and hypothyroidism. On palpation, the gland can be abnormally firm but not usually enlarged.",,,,,,,

Hemochromatosis is a disease produced by an excess absorption of iron, which leads to deposition of excess iron in the
tissues, especially the liver. Laboratory changes include an increased serum iron, a decreased TIBC, an increased % transferrin
saturation, and an increased ferritin level. AST is usually elevated.

Diet- protein malnutrition
Conditions of tow protein in the body, such as malnutrition, starvation, nephrotic syndrome, or cancer, can cause a decreased
level of TIBC.","Anemia- iron deficiency
If the total iron binding capacity is increased along with a decreased total iron, MCV, MCH, Serum ferritin, % transferrin
saturation, and/or HGB and/or HCT , iron anemia is probable.

Internal bleeding
With a high TIBC there is always the possibility of microscopic bleeding, which should be ruled out with reticulocyte count,
urinalysis, and/or stool analysis.","© Chronic inflammatory disorders

TMAO,"Circulating levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) have been closely associated with the development of atherosclerosis,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other metabolic dysfunctions such as renal disease. TMAO may contribute to
atherosclerosis by promoting foam cell formation, triggering inflammation, altering cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, and
affecting reverse cholesterol transport and platelet aggregation.","Elevated TMAO has been associated with cardiovascular disease and is observed in metabolic disorders such as diabetes and
renal dysfunction. However, for some individuals traditionally considered to be at “low risk” for CVD (nonsmokers, < 65 years
old, LDL-C <100 mg/dL, normal blood pressure), elevated TMAO was a significant predictor of major adverse coronary events.
TMAO is formed when liver enzymes convert trimethylamine (TMA) to TMAO. Certain GI bacteria form TMA from dietary
precursors such as choline, phosphatidylcholine, betaine, y-butyrobetaine, and L-carnitine. TMA released into circulation
travels to the liver where it is converted to TMAO.

Dietary sources of TMA precursors include red meat, egg yolk, dairy products, and supplements (L-carnitine, choline,
phosphatidylcholine, betaine, and lecithin). Preformed TMAO is found in select foods (e.g, fish, mollusks, and crustaceans).
Although TMAO levels may increase with the consumption of TMAO from fish, preformed TMAO is not currently associated
with the same cardiovascular risk as bacterial-derived TMAO. Preformed dietary TMAO consumed within 24 hours of testing
may falsely elevate TMAO levels.

Modification of lifestyle habits in high risk patients can help reduce TMAO: adopt a plant-based or Mediterranean diet and limit
intake of TMAO precursors (red meat, egg yolk, dairy products, and supplements).

Also, research suggests that the compound DMB (3,3-Dimethy!-1-butanol) may inhibit production of bacterial-derived TMAO.
Foods that are rich in DMB include cold-pressed olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and red wine.

Bacterial Conversion

Bacteria that produce TMA from dietary precursors include Akkermansia muciniphila and Desulfovibrio bacteria. However,
Akkermansia also plays a beneficial role in GI health, confounding clear guidance as to the most beneficial composition for Gl
bacteria.

Bacteria within the Ruminococcus genus correlated with elevated levels of TMA and TMAO and atherosclerotic lesions in mice,
and atherosclerotic heart disease in humans.

In general, research indicated that presence of more Firmicutes than Bacteroidetes, and less gut microbiota diversity, was
associated with increased levels of TMAO following dietary precursors.

Strategies to modify GI microbial composition may hold promise, including probiotic/prebiotic supplementation, and
promotion of bacteria that use TMAO as a substrate.",0,6.2,0,6.2,0,3.7,0,3.7,uM,uM,"Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic dysfunction
Low levels of TMAO indicate a reduced risk of TMAO-related cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction. Assessment of TMAO
should be part of a comprehensive cardiovascular and metabolic assessment.","Increased risk of cardiovascular disease and events

Elevated levels of TMAO are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart
failure, and death. For every 10 umol/L increase in TMAO, there is a 7.6% increase in relative risk of mortality. Elevated TMAO
was associated with an increased 5-year mortality from coronary artery or peripheral artery disease and an increased 7-year
mortality risk in acute coronary syndrome.

Diabetes

Elevated TMAO levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes and an increased 5-year mortality risk in those with type 2
diabetes.

Gut dysbiosis

Elevated levels of TMAO indicate an imbalance of or increased presence of microorganisms capable of converting nutrient
precursors to trimethylamine.

Renal dysfunction

Elevated TMAO levels are associated with renal dysfunction in two ways. Levels will be elevated due to decreased renal
clearance, and elevated levels may contribute to inflammation and atherosclerosis of renal arteries.",,,,,,,
Total WBCs,"The total White Blood Cell (WBC) count measures the sum of all the WBCs in the peripheral blood. White Blood Cells fight
infection, defend the body through a process called phagocytosis, and produce, transport, and distribute antibodies as part of
the immune process. It is important to look at the WBC differential count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc.) to locate the source
of an increased or decreased WBC count. Decreased total White Blood Cell Leveis are associated with chronic bacterial or
viral infections, immune insufficiency, and may be seen in people eating a raw food diet. Increased total White Blood Cell
Levels are associated with acute bacterial or viral infections and may be seen in people who eat a diet of highly refined foods.","White blood cells or leukocytes of the peripheral blood are divided into 2 groups:

1. Granulocytes:

This group consists of neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils, which are formed in the bone marrow and receives their name
from the granules that are present in the cytoplasm. They also contain a multi-lobed nucleus and are often referred to as
“polys” or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).

2. Agranulocytes:

This group consists of monocytes and tymphocytes. They have no granules in their cytoplasm and non-lobular nuclei.
Monocytes originate in the bone marrow, and lymphocytes are formed from lymphoblasts in the reticuloendothelial tissues of
the spleen, lymph glands, tonsils, thymus, and appendix.

The number of leukocytes in the blood is regulated by the endocrine system. Production from the blood-forming organs, their
storage, release from the tissue, and ultimate disintegration is affected by hormones. The lifespan of leukocytes varies from 13
to 20 days.",3.8,10.8,3.8,10.8x10,3.8,6,3.8,6x10,k/cumm,9/L,"Chronic viral infection

In a chronic viral infection the total WBC count will be decreased, as the body is using up its WBCs. Decreased total WBC,
increased lymphocyte count, decreased neutrophils, decreased LDH isoenzymes due to a decrease in the total WBC and an
increased monocytes during the recovery phase.

Chronic bacterial infection

The total WBC count in a chronic bacterial infection will often be opposite of that seen with active infection: Decreased total
WBC, increased neutrophils, decreased lymphocyte count, and decreased LDH isoenzymes due to a decrease in the total
WBC. Expect to see an increased monocyte count during the recovery phase.

Pancreatic insufficiency

The body responds to pancreatic insufficiency by using phagocytic white cells to do the job of breaking down food and
clearing food residue from the system. This is known as leukocytic auto digestion and can cause a decreased white count.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE)

SLE is a disease characterized by inflammation in several organ systems and the production of auto-antibodies that cause
cellular injury. It is a disease of extreme variability in clinical and laboratory presentation. Nearly half of all people suffering
from SLE have leukopenia, and anemia is usually present in the active disease. SLE is possible with decreased WBC count and
C-complement, and an increased ANA, Alpha 1 globulin, C reactive protein, and gamma globulin.

Decreased production

If the following chemistries are out of range we can suspect a functional decreased production from the bone marrow:
Decreased total WBC, RBCs, cholesterol, magnesium, and BUN with an increased MCV. Certain drugs, chemotherapeutic
agents, radiation, and heavy metals can cause bone marrow depression.

Raw food diet

The total WBC will frequently be slightly below the optimum range for patients on a diet high in raw foods.","Childhood diseases (Measles, Mumps, Chicken-pox, Rubella, etc.)

Total WBC is increased early in the disease process and will be decreased later. The increase in total WBC may be so great as
to suggest leukemia. Such a leukocytosis of a temporary nature must be distinguished from leukemia. In general the following
common patterns may be seen in childhood disease: Neutrophils: Increased early. Decreased later. Lymphocytes: Decreased
early. Increased later. The findings relative to the WBC differential are variable due to the increases or decreases in the other
WBC fractions (eosinophils, Monocytes, basophils)

Acute viral infection

This is a strong inflammatory process so expect to see an increased ESR. The total WBC will be elevated due to the increased
levels of individual fractions. Increased Lymphocytes and normal Neutrophils = Acute viral picture. Increased Monocytes
indicate the recovery period. Increased Bands- Expect to see increased Band cells in the acute phase as the body is pumping
out immature neutrophils to cope with the infection. Bands can be used to help differentiate an active from a chronic infection.
In the active phase of infection bands will tend to become increased and their levels tend to normalize during recovery or
during the chronic phase. Checking viral titers may be helpful.

Triglyceride - Glucose Index (TyG),"The Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) Index is a valuable prevention tool that can identify insulin resistance and its associated
complications early on. It is based on fasting triglycerides and fasting glucose. An increased TyG Index reflects glucose
dysregulation and metabolic dysfunction and is directly associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders,
including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.","Research suggests that the TyG Index is a better predictor of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes incidence than other
commonly used markers. It is imperative that insulin resistance be identified and addressed early due to its wide-ranging
metabolic complications, including defective glucose uptake, decreased glycogen synthesis, reduced suppression of lipid
oxidation, increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity. The TyG Index is a valuable tool
that is more convenient and cost-effective than the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp or HOMA calculations, which involve
measuring either fasting insulin or c-peptide along with fasting glucose. There is an established association between increased
TyG Index and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes, diabetes, hypertension, arterial stiffness, CVD, stroke, and obesity-related
cancer (Liu 2021).

The TyG Index is a valuable, convenient, and cost-effective tool for assessing these risks. An elevated TyG Index is associated
with increased cardiometabolic outcomes, diabetes, hypertension, and other health issues. Nutrition and lifestyle changes can
improve triglyceride and glucose levels, affecting the TyG Index. Studies have found a connection between higher TyG Index

Triglycerides,"Serum triglycerides are composed of fatty acid molecules that enter the bloodstream either from the liver or from the diet.
Patients that are optimally metabolizing their fats and carbohydrates tend to have a triglyceride level about one-half of the
total cholesterol level. Levels will be elevated in metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, in patients with an increased risk of
cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism, and adrenal dysfunction. Levels will be decreased in liver dysfunction, a diet deficient
in fat, and inflammatory processes.","Serum triglyceride levels are very much influenced by dietary fat consumption. Non-fasting samples are often the source of
elevated triglycerides. A 12-hour fast is recommended to prevent the influence of dietary intake of fat on the sample. Post-
prandial levels of triglycerides begin to rise about 2 hours after a meal, peaking at 4-6 hours.

Exogenous sources of triglycerides:

In the digestive tract dietary fat, which is mostly triglyceride, is emulsified and broken down by pancreatic lipase into its
constituent free fatty acids. These enter the intestinal mucosal cells and are re-formed into triglycerides that are incorporated
into chylomicrons. The chylomicrons enter the bloodstream via the lymphatic lacteals and are cleared from the blood by tissue
lipoprotein lipase, which breaks the triglycerides down into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids are used for
energy by the heart and skeletal muscle. They are also transported to the liver bound to albumin and/or reformed into
triglycerides to be stored in adipose tissue.

Endogenous sources of triglycerides:

Endogenous sources of triglycerides come primarily from the liver, which synthesizes triglycerides from free fatty acids and
glycerol.

patients with abnormally elevated triglycerides and cholesterol level should be followed up with the VAP test, which is one of
the best methods of assessing the metabolic problems associated with abnormal serum lipid values.",0,149.99,0,1.69,70,80,0.79,0.9,mg/dL,mmol/L,"Liver/biliary dysfunction
Biliary congestion/stasis can impact on the emulsification and digestion of fats, which may lead to a decreased level of
triglycerides <70 or <0.79 mmol/l. Liver dysfunction, such as fatty liver, can also prevent the synthesis of endogenous
triglycerides and other lipids and lipoproteins. Biliary congestion/stasis can often be caused by a mild obstruction in the extra-
hepatic biliary duct. Here are the findings on a blood test for biliary congestion/stasis: GGTP levels will frequently be increased
but not necessarily, Bilirubin levels will also be elevated, Increased alkaline phosphatase, Increased total cholesterol, AST and
ALT may be normal or increased. Also, many cases of biliary congestion/stasis will show normal lab values.

Diet- Nutrient deficient, insufficient fat intake, vegetarian diet
Dietary intake of healthy fats maybe low, a pattern that is commonly seen in vegetarians.

Thyroid hyperfunction
Hyperthyroidism is probable if there are low triglycerides with a low TSH and a high total T-3, elevated free T3 and an elevated
total T4. The low triglyceride levels are probably due to the excessive utilization of fatty acids by a metabolism that is
excessively fast.

Autoimmune processes
If triglycerides are decreased with low or normal cholesterol and an increased HDL, then some kind of autoimmune process in
the body is possible. The problem may be inflammatory or destructive in nature. Consider further testing to rule-out tissue
inflammation or destruction (C-reactive protein, ANA, rheumatoid factor etc.). If tissue destruction is present, LDH, Alpha 1 or
Alpha 2 globulin (seen with serum protein electrophoresis) will frequently be increased. This may also be a sign of endocrine
dysfunction due to endocrine hypo or hyper function. Consider further endocrine testing to locate cause of the disturbance.","Metabolic Syndrome /hyperinsulinemia/earty stage diabetes

If triglycerides are increased above the total cholesterol level with increased LDL cholesterol, a decreased HDL, and increased
fasting blood glucose, then metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia is probable. Metabolic Syndrome can lead to adrenal
dysregulation, so adrenal hyperfunctioning should be ruled out. Elevated triglycerides are seen in patients with diabetes. The
triglycerides are often higher than the total cholesterol level. Lipid metabolism problems are a hallmark of the early stages of
diabetes.

Fatty liver and Liver congestion

Increased triglycerides are associated with liver congestion and the early development of fatty liver (steatosis). If total
cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels are increased, and HDL levels are decreased, then the early development of fatty liver is
possible. Liver congestion, due to the fatty liver, should be considered if total cholesterol is above 180, triglycerides are
increased , and the ALT is decreased.

Early stage of insulin resistance

Elevated triglycerides often accompany the elevated glucose levels that are seen in hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance.
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and atherosclerosis

An increased triglyceride level is associated with the development of atherosclerosis and an increase in cardiovascular risk and
stroke. Atherosclerosis is probable with an increased triglyceride level in relation to total cholesterol with an increased uric acid
level (>5.9 or > 351 mmol/dL), a decreased HDL and an increased LDL. Platelet levels may also be increased (>385).
Homocysteine levels are frequently increased with atherosclerosis. Hs-CRP and fibrinogen levels are frequently increased.
Diabetes and thyroid hypofunction should also be considered with this pattern.

Poor metabolism and utilization of fats

This is often the case in patients that are eating an optimal diet and have elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels.

Tryptase,"Tryptases are enzymes mainly produced by mast cells, with smailer amounts made by basophils. Elevated tryptase levels are
crucial markers in diagnosing conditions related to mast cell activation, including anaphylaxis, allergies, and mastocytosis. High
tryptase can indicate severe systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis, where it reflects acute mast cell degranulation often
triggered by allergens. In mastocytosis, elevated tryptase levels signify an abnormal proliferation of mast cells, which can lead
to more persistent elevations.

Understanding these levels helps diagnose mast cell activation syndrome, especially when there is a significant increase from
baseline levels following an allergic reaction, suggesting excessive mast cell activity. Proper assessment of tryptase is essential
for managing and diagnosing these conditions, emphasizing its role in indicating the severity and extent of mast cell
involvement in allergic responses and systemic disorders.

Low tryptase levels suggest a decreased risk of mast cell activation, mastocytosis, and anaphylaxis.","Tryptases are serine protease enzymes produced primarily by mast cells and in smaller amounts by basophils. Basal serum
tryptase (BST) levets reflect the total body burden of mast cells, while an acute increase over basal (over baseline) indicates
severe systemic mast cell activation (MCA) and likely anaphylaxis. Symptoms of anaphylaxis may include severe hypotension,
collapse, itching, allergic asthma, edema, skin rash, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting (Valent 2024).

Serum tryptase is essential for documenting mast cell activation. Serum tryptase will increase and peak approximately 60
minutes after a triggering event and can remain elevated for three hours or longer. Tryptase elevation in mast cell activation is
associated with a drop in blood pressure and symptoms involving the skin, Gl tract, respiratory tract, and cardiovascular
system. Anaphylaxis involves at least two organ systems and can be severe and even fatal (Gulen 2024).

Severe mast cell activation and anaphylaxis are most commonly associated with IgE-mediated allergies. The 20 + 2 rule is
considered the gold standard for evaluating mast cell activation as it takes into account basal and acute tryptase levels. A
tryptase increase of at least 20% + 2 ug/L above basal reflects severe mast cell activation and is considered a specific
indicator of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). Basal tryptase can vary depending on gender, age, kidney function,
underlying mast cell-related disorders, including cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis, and genetic factors, such as hereditary
alpha-tryptasemia (HaT).

However, elevated BST can also be seen with chronic renal failure, parasitic

infection, and bone marrow disorders, including myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes. A tryptase
above 15 pg/L is likely associated with systemic mast cell activation or genetically elevated baseline tryptase. Aggressive
systemic mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia may be associated with tryptase levels of SOO-1,000 pg/L and above (Valent
2024).

Elevated tryptase in renal failure is likely due to kidney inflammation and injury due to local mast cells. Tryptase above 17.3
ug/L may be seen with chronic renal failure with levels increasing as kidney function decreases. Anaphylactic shock is
associated with markedly elevated tryptase with levels exceeding 74 ug/L, while levels of 15 ug/L and above can be seen with
urticaria/angioedema without anaphylaxis. Chronically elevated tryptase can also be associated with acute coronary
syndrome, major adverse cardiovascular events, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and eosinophilic esophagitis characterized by
abdominal pain, urticaria, asthma, and arthralgia. Tryptase can promote inflammation, chemotaxis, and fibroblast proliferation
(Lee 2020).

Chronic inflammatory disease, chronic infection, and obesity may be associated with basal serum tryptase levels of up to 2S
ug/L. Researchers emphasize that serum tryptase must be evaluated in conjunction with symptoms and clinical presentation.
An out-of-range level without concurrent symptoms may not be diagnostically relevant. individual BST should be determined
whenever possible. A BST of up to 15 ug/L may be maintained without adverse effects. Diagnosis of mast cell activation
syndrome requires an increase in baseline tryptase of at least 120% + 2 g/L, clinical symptoms, and relief from therapeutic
intervention (Valent 2023).

The WHO considers a basal serum tryptase above 20 g/L a minor criterion for diagnosing systemic mastocytosis, a level that
may trigger a bone marrow biopsy for symptomatic individuals. However, genetic testing for hereditary alpha-tryptasemia
should be undertaken first to avoid potentially unnecessarily invasive procedures. HaT accounts for most elevations in basal
serum tryptase and can magnify hypersensitivity reactions. An individual with a BST of 8 g/L or more should be worked up
for HaT. A review of NIH tryptase genotyping data found that 97.3% of individuals with a BST between 8 and 11.4 ug/L had HaT
or clonal mast cell disease (MCD) (Chovanec 2023). A retrospective study of 109 individuals found that 63,8% of those with a
BST of 11.5 ug/L or above had HaT, 20.7% had clonal myeloid disorders, and 12.1% had chronic kidney disease (Waters 2022).

Less than 5% of the general population is expected to have a BST above 8 pg/L (Chovanec 2023), while the median BST for
individuals without HaT or indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) is 4.1 ug/L. Calculating the acute to basal/baseline serum
tryptase ratio can help identify anaphylaxis, including in individuals with HaT or ISM. A ratio above 1.685 improves specificity
for anaphylaxis when assessing these subjects and a threshold of 1.374 is comparable to the gold standard of 20% +2 ug/L
above basal for identifying severe mast cell activation (Mateja 2022). A threshold ratio of 1.5 or above may be associated with
food allergy-related anaphylaxis (Wongkaewpothong 2014). The acute to basal tryptase ratio can be calculated and
interpreted at https://triptase-calculator.niaid.nih.gov/ (NIH TRIPTASE).
A comprehensive evaluation of elevated tryptase should include a series of measurements over to time to determine
basal/baseline levels and individual variability (Pongdee 2022).
Genetic tryptasemia testing may be indicated in those with a BST of 8 g/L or above with severe allergic reactions, cutaneous
flushing, itching, chronic pain, connective tissue abnormalities, and/or a diagnosis of MCAS, postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome (dysautonomia), gastroparesis, or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (genebygene.com/tryptase).

Increased tryptase levels may be caused by mast cell activation during an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. Severe IgE-mediated
allergies may lead to anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that can be fatal.

Anaphylaxis

Elevated tryptase is associated with anaphylaxis, a severe immune reaction characterized by low blood pressure, itching, rash,
asthma, gastrointestinal distress, and collapse. Severe anaphylaxis can be fatal.

Bone Marrow Disorders

Elevated tryptase is commonly seen with myeloid malignancies, such as acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
syndromes, and myeloproliferative disorders.

Genetic Factors

Genetic conditions such as hereditary alpha-tryptasemia and acquired mastocytosis can cause elevated baseline tryptase,
which increases further during mast cell activation or anaphylaxis.

Kidney Failure

The elevation in tryptase seen with kidney disease is likely due to inflammation and damage caused by loca! mast cells. The
degree of elevation is associated with the degree of renal failure.

Mast cell activation, mastocytosis

Tryptase is primarily produced and released by immune mast cells. Levels are notably increased after mast cell activation,
usually by a specific trigger. Mastocytosis is due to an increased number of mast cells, tissue tryptase accumulation, and higher
basal/baseline serum tryptase. Mastocytosis may be confined to the skin (cutaneous) or systemic. Systemic mastocytosis is
associated with higher tryptase levels than cutaneous mastocytosis.",,,,,,,
TSH,"TSH or thyroid-stimulating hormone is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary to control the thyroid gland’s production
of T4, to store T4, and to release it into the bloodstream. TSH synthesis and secretion is regulated by the release of TRH
(Thyroid Releasing Hormone) from the hypothalamus. TSH levels describe the body's desire for more thyroid hormone (T4 or
T3), which is done in relation to the body’s need for energy. A high TSH is the body's way of saying “we need more thyroid
hormone”. A low TSH reflects the body’s low need for thyroid hormone. Optimal TSH levels, in a normally functioning pituitary,
can tell us that the amount of T4 in the blood matches the body's current need and/or ability to utilize the energy necessary
for optimal cell function. When the pituitary is not functioning in an optimal manner, the TSH test can be quite misleading.","TSH is the most sensitive test for primary hypothyroidism. However if there is a clinical picture of hypothyroidism, yet the TSH
is normal then investigate other causes within the thyroid-pituitary-hypothalamic feedback axis.

With normal thyroid and anterior pituitary/hypothalamus function, a decreased T-3 and T-4 causes an increase in TSH, and an
increase in T-3 and T-4 causes a decrease in TSH. TSH is an integral part of a thyroid panel useful for the determination and
potential differentiation of hypothyroidism.

TSH is used to diagnose primary hypothyroidism when there is a problem intrinsic to the thyroid gland itself. TSH levels will be
elevated. When TSH levels are decreased the problem may be reflective of a hyperthyroid state. Also consider that the
problem may be due to abnormalities outside the thyroid in the pituitary-hypothalamic axis, which cause a secondary and
even tertiary hypothyroidism.

Although sensitive, it is not uncommon for a patient with a clinical picture of hypothyroidism to have completely “normal”
serum thyroid tests. In these cases this should alert the clinician to an etiology other than an intrinsic thyroid gland
dysfunction (i.e. increased tissue resistance to thyroid hormone.) Consider other low T-3 syndromes or T4 conversion
problems.",0.4,4.5,0.4,4.5,1,2,1,2,mIU/L,mIU/L,"Hyperthyroidism
Although less common than hypothyroidism, the following pattern may help elucidate a developing or existent hyperthyroid
state. Hyperthyroidism is possible if TSH is low, The likelinood increases when there is also an increased Total T3, Increased
Free T3, T3 uptake, Increased FTI and/or Increased T4.Consider running thyroid antibody studies to rule out Hashimoto's
thyroiditis and Grave’s disease. Rule-out food allergy/sensitivities, environmental sensitivities, recent
immunizations/inoculations, viral infections, and other auto-immune problems in any cases of suspected hyperthyroidism.

Secondary Hypothyroidism (Anterior Pituitary Hypofunction)
Thyroid hypofunction is often secondary to an anterior pituitary hypofunction (Secondary Hypothyroidism). Suspect anterior
pituitary dysfunction if the subjective indications of thyroid hypofunction are present and the following pattern is seen: A
decreased TSH, a normal T-3 uptake, a decreased or normal Total T4, a normal or decreased Free T4 and a normal or
decreased Free T3. The likelihood increases if serum triglycerides are elevated and total cholesterol is increased. Additional
elements that may be out of range with secondary hypothyrodism include an increased BUN above the “normal” range and an
increased calcium. Anterior pituitary hypofunction is a common problem and one that is frequently mistaken for thyroid
hypofunction (the subjective indications are usually identical and the patient’s axillary temperature will frequently be below
normal).

Tertiary hypothyroidism (Hypothalamus hypofunction)
In tertiary hypothyroidism, the hypothalamus shuts down protectively in response to stress, producing low levels of TSH, T4,
and T3. This is often linked to chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, this condition can cause low body temperatures, a
tendency toward infections, and the other metabolic consequences of low thyroid. It has been suggested that problems with
the mitochondria, the cellular structures that furnish us with energy, may cause this suppression of the hypothalamus. A
decreased TSH level may be due to an inadequate secretion of Thyroid Releasing Hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.
Please see the special topic below on the differentiation of hypothyroid classification for more details.

Heavy metal body burden (e.g. lead, aluminum, cadmium and other toxic metals)
Consider a heavy metal body burden with a thyroid condition that is unresponsive to treatment. Specific metals include
aluminum, mercury, and cadmium that act as disruptors to thyroid receptor activity. One of the significant effects of toxic
metals is the impact they have on red blood cells especially hemoglobin. If MCH and MCHC is decreased with a decreased uric
acid, suspect a heavy metal body burden. Confirm with a hair analysis or toxic element testing via blood or urine.","Primary hypothyroidism
In primary hypothyroidism the problem is located in the thyroid gland itself, which fails to produce thyroid hormone. Primary
hypothyroidism is often preceded by autoimmune thyroid disease. If you have a patient with suspected thyroid disease you
should screen for thyroid antibodies. Primary hypothyroidism will present with increased TSH levels and you may see a normal
or decreased total T4 level and/or T-3, free T4, free T3, increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels.","© Protein malnutrition

UIBC,"UIBC measures the unsaturated binding capacity of transferrin, the protein that carries iron in the body i.e. UIBC measures
levels of transferrin that have not bound to iron. Assessment of UIBC helps diagnose iron-deficiency or overload.","Unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) helps assess your body’s iron status and capacity to transport iron in the blood. Most
circulating iron is bound to a protein called transferrin. Normally “ of transferrin is saturated with iron, leaving % available to
pick up more iron.Because 2/3 of transferrin is unbound, the body has a great capacity to bind iron. This 2/3 portion
represents the Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC).

Said another way, VIBC measures the unsaturated binding capacity of transferrin i.e. it measures levels of transferrin that have
not bound iron.

Assessment of UIBC helps diagnose iron-deficiency or overload. It may be ordered along with a serum iron and other tests in
the case of low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels or in suspected iron overload.

The body makes transferrin based on iron needs. Generally about one-third of transferrin is used to bind and transport iron.
TIBC (total iron binding capacity) is UIBC plus the serum iron measurement. It is therefore a calculated measurement:

TIBC = UIBC + Serum Iron, therefore:

UIBC = TIBC - Serum Iron",110,350,19.7,62.68,130,300,23.28,53.73,ug/dL,umol/L,"Note: Microscopic bleeding

The probability of microscopic internal bleeding is high if the UIBC is decreased along with a decreased TIBC and an increased
reticulocyte count. This patient should be referred to a doctor qualified to diagnose and treat internal bleeding.
Hemochromatosis/ hemosiderosis/iron overload

Hemochromatosis is a disease produced by an excess absorption of iron, which leads to deposition of excess iron in the
tissues, especially the liver. Laboratory changes include an increased serum iron (>130 or 23.27 mmol/dL), a decreased UIBC
(<130 or 23.3 mmol/L), a decreased TIBC (<250 or 44.8 mmol/dL), an increased % transferrin saturation (usually > 60%), and
an increased ferritin level (>160 ng/ml in women, > 200 ng/ml in men and often >1000). SGOT/AST is usually elevated (>40).
Cobalamin Deficiency

UIBC may be decreased in cobalamin deficiency but return to normal with cobalamin therapy. Further investigation of iron
status should be conducted as research suggests that cobalamin deficiency may mask iron deficiency.","Anemia- iron deficiency

If the UIBC is elevated and the total iron binding capacity is increased (>350 or 62.7 mmol/dL) along with a decreased total
iron ¢< 85 or 15.22 mmol/dL), MCV (<82), MCH (<28), Serum ferritin (< 30), % transferrin saturation, and/or HGB (<13.5 or 135
a/L in women and <14 or 140 in men) and/or HCT (<37 or 0.37 in women and 40 or 0.4 in men), iron anemia is probable.

Uric Acid - Female,"Uric acid is produced as an end-product of purine, nucleic acid, and nucleoprotein metabolism. Levels can increase due to
over-production by the body or decreased excretion by the kidneys. Increased uric acid levels are associated with gout,
atherosclerosis, oxidative stress, arthritis, kidney dysfunction, circulatory disorders and intestinal permeability. Decreased levels
are associated with detoxification issues, molybdenum deficiency, B12/folate anemia, and copper deficiency.","Levels represent the end product of protein utilization and deamination in the liver. The kidneys store and excrete about
2/3rds of the uric acid produced daily, making it an indirect marker of renal function as well. The remaining 1/3rd is excreted in
the stool. Uric acid is the end-product of xanthine oxidase activation and reduced tissue oxygenation will induce its
production. An over-production of uric acid occurs in conditions of excessive breakdown and catabolism of nucleic acids,
increased destruction of cells and an inability to adequately excrete uric acid.

The “Normal” focus of uric acid measurement is for gout, renal failure, and leukemia. However, this marker is a very strong
indicator for potential inflammation and metabolic disturbance.

When inflammation is present the body wants to start laying down protective tissue (bone spurs, atherosclerosis, fibrosis etc.)
and this activates xanthine oxidase pathways causing increased uric acid levels.

Dietary purines from dark meat, organ meats, pork, shellfish, tegumes etc. may be a cause of increased uric acid levels and
should therefore be limited when treating patients with elevated uric acid levels. However, chemical and physical stressors are
the most common reasons for an elevation.

There are many potential interferences for uric acid levels as it is quite labile. As a result, serial measurements are most useful
for making clinical inferences. Daily and seasonal variations, obesity, stress levels etc. all can play a major role in its
metabolism.

Over % of patients with heart disease and high triglycerides will present with elevated levels of uric acid. The role of
oxidative stress in the process of cardiovascular disease cannot be over-emphasized. Consider oxidative stress measurements
with an elevated uric acid history.",2.5,7,148.7,416.36,3,4.7,178.44,279.56,mg/dL,umol/L,"Molybdenum Deficiency
Suspect molybdenum deficiency if there is a decreased uric acid tevel and a normal MCV and MCH.

Anemia- B12/Folate Deficiency
A decreased uric acid level is associated with a chronic B12/folate anemia. By no means a sole diagnostic indicator, it should
be viewed in context with the appropriate red blood cell indices (RBCs, MCV, MCH, and MCHC) and a methylmelonic acid test.

Copper Deficiency
Low Uric acid levels have been associated with a potential copper deficiency.

Pregnancy
Uric acid is valuable in assessing the prognosis of eclampsia because of the uric acid levels ability to reflect the extent of liver
damage in toxemia of pregnancy.","Gout

Increased uric acid levels are associated with Gout, which is a condition in which uric acid crystals precipitate in the tissue,
especially the big toe (tophi). If there is an increased uric acid, Gout is possible. The likelihood increases if there is aiso a
decreased phosphorous, an increased cholesterol, an increased BUN and a normal or increased creatinine.

Increased risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke

An increased uric acid level is associated with chronic inflammatory states including those in the vascular system. This is one of
the precipitating factors in the development of atherosclerosis. If there is an increased uric acid level with an increased
triglyceride level in relation to total cholesterol with a decreased HDL and an increased LDL, atherosclerosis is probable.
Platelet levels may also be increased. Homocysteine levels are frequently increased with atherosclerosis. Hs-CRP are frequently
increased, and fibrinogen levels are frequently increased. If the above pattern is not present and the uric acid level is elevated
still consider running a serum homocysteine, as a homocysteinuria may be the locus of a developing problem.

Oxidative Stress and Free Radical Activity

If the uric acid level is high, it could point to an overabundance of free radical activity and oxidative stress. This condition
should be explored further if the total cholesterol level suddenly drops from its usual range. Other potential signs include a
decrease in lymphocyte count, albumin, and platelet levels. An increase in total globulin also indicates a free radical pathology,
heightening the risk for neoplasm development. Oxidative stress can lead to a higher red blood cell destruction rate, often
marked by an elevated bilirubin level.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Elevated uric acid levels often correspond with chronic inflammation and are a common characteristic of conditions like
Rheumatoid Arthritis. The development of rheumatoid arthritis may be indicated by an increase in uric acid level, an elevated
ESR, and a decrease or normal level of albumin and alkaline phosphatase. The serum calcium level might be increased or
remain normal. To better understand the nature of the joint pain, consider further investigation with appropriate diagnostic
tests or a Rheumatoid panel.

Renal insufficiency

Elevated uric acid levels can be indicative of renal insufficiency. This condition is often overlooked. Renal insufficiency should
be suspected if there is an increase in BUN level, even with normal or elevated serum creatinine. Concurrently, uric acid levels
might be normal or increased, as can serum phosphorous. Both LDH and AST are usually within the normal range.

Renal disease

Higher uric acid levels are often associated with decreased renal function. The presence of increased BUN, serum creatinine,
BUN(/creatinine ratio, urine specific gravity, uric acid, serum phosphorous, LDH, and AST may indicate impaired renal function.
If such a pattern is observed, the condition should either be ruled out or referred to a qualified practitioner.

Circulatory disorders

patients who exhibit increased uric acid levels should be evaluated for potential circulatory disorders. Poor circulation
activates the enzyme Xanthine oxidase, crucial for uric acid formation, resulting in elevated uric acid levels and a superoxide
radicat. Conditions like Hypertension, Raynaud’s, Atherosclerosis, and Polycythemia should be considered and treated
accordingly.

Intestinal Hyperpermeability

Consider an altered intestinal permeability when uric acid levels are elevated, and an underlying inflammatory issue exists.
Various organisms such as bacteria, yeast, and amoebas and their toxins can be readily absorbed in a compromised digestive
barrier, often leading to an auto-immune response. Treatment should focus on restoring gut integrity and correcting the
dysbiotic terrain. Note that a common initial reaction, known as the Herxheimer reaction, might occur due to an increased
release of endotoxins during early treatment.","© Wilson's disease

Vitamin A Retinol,"Retinol is the primary form of vitamin A in circulation and the key marker of vitamin A status. Vitamin A is vital for a number of
physiological functions in the body. Elevated Vitamin A Retinol levels are associated with excess supplementation or dietary
intake, which can have a negative toxic effect on the body. Decreased Vitamin A Retinol levels are associated with impaired
night vision and a trend towards immune insufficiency and infections.","Vitamin A is an array of compounds including retinal, retinoic acid, and retinol, the primary form in circulation, and the key
marker of vitamin A status.

The retinal form is crucial to vision while retinoic acid is required for cell division and differentiation.

Circulating retinol is a key marker of vitamin A status. It circulates bound to retinol-binding protein and albumin; a deficiency
of either of these can affect the measurement of retinol. Serum retinol, retinol-binding protein, and albumin can be affected
during inflammation or acute phase response, possibly yielding false-negative results.

While circulating retinol is the most important biomarker for estimating vitamin A status, measurement of circulating retinol
and beta-carotene together can be used to fully assess vitamin A status.

Retinol results within the normal range indicate sufficiency but do not reflect how much vitamin A is in storage. Once storage
levels are dangerously low or depleted, circulating retinol levels will drop. Increased demands such as illness or pregnancy may
quickly deplete reserves and decrease circulating levels.

Vitamin A is vital to immune function; reproduction; embryonic development; tissue differentiation; organ development;
Mucous membrane maintenance; bone formation; vision; and skin function and integrity.

Causes of vitamin A deficiency include malnutrition: fat malabsorption; bariatric surgery; celiac disease: irritable bowel
syndrome; inflammatory bowel disease: cystic fibrosis; pancreatitis; alcoholism; and liver disease.

Elevated levels of vitamin A are associated with excessive supplementation or dietary intake. Toxicity can cause nausea;
vomiting; weight loss; double or blurred vision; dizziness; headache; irritability; loss of muscle coordination; muscle, bone, and
joint pain; seizures; fatigue; itching; sloughing off of skin; hair loss; cheilosis (cracks in the corner of the mouth); glossitis
inflammation of the tongue); bone demineralization; bone fractures; hypercalcemia; enlarged lymph nodes; hyperlipidemia;
amenorrhea; miscarriages; and birth defects.

Excess build up in the liver can cause liver dysfunction, hepatosplenomegaly, fibrosis, and portal hypertension. An elevated
level of vitamin A can be seen with renal failure and elevated levels are associated with increased risk of hip fracture.

Low levels of vitamin A may be associated with impaired night vision (one of the first signs of deficiency); Bitot spots (grey
spots on the conjunctiva); eye damage; blindness: dry skin, hair, and eyes; thickening of the skin; follicular hyperkeratosis;
anemia; immune insufficiency; and infection. Low levels of beta-carotene may be associated with steatorrhea (fatty stools due
to malabsorption); oral contraceptive use, and smoking.

Vitamin B12,"Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient for DNA synthesis and red blood cell maturation and is also necessary for myelin sheath
formation and the maintenance of nerves in the body. Decreased serum B12 levets are associated with a deficiency of B12,
insufficient B12 intake in the diet, or malabsorption. Paradoxically, elevated serum B12 levels may be accompanied by signs of
B12 deficiency and may indicate a functional deficiency marked by inadequate uptake at the tissue level","Vitamin B12 is a complex corrinoid compound containing four pyrrole rings that surround a single cobalt atom. Humans obtain
vitamin B12 exclusively from animal dietary sources, such as meat, eggs, and milk. Vitamin B12 requires intrinsic factor, a
protein secreted by the parietal cells in the gastric mucosa, for absorption. Vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor form a complex that
attaches to receptors in the ileal mucosa, where proteins known as transcobalamins transport the vitamin B12 from the
mucosal cells to the blood and tissue. Most vitamin BI2 is stored in the liver as well as in the bone marrow and other tissues.
Vitamin B12 and folate are critical to normal DNA synthesis, which in turn affects erythrocyte maturation. Vitamin B12 is also
necessary for myelin sheath formation and maintenance. The body uses its B12 stores very economically, reabsorbing vitamin
B12 from the ileum and returning it to the liver so that very little is excreted.

Clinical and laboratory findings for B12 deficiency include neurological abnormalities, decreased serum B12 levels, and
increased excretion of methylmatonic acid. When a B12 is normal but a deficiency is still suspected, a doctor may order a
methylmalonic acid (MMA) test as an early indicator of B12 deficiency. The impaired synthesis associated with vitamin B12
deficiency causes macrocytic anemias. These anemias are characterized by abnormal maturation of erythrocyte precursors in
the bone marrow, which results in the presence of megaloblasts and in decreased erythrocyte survival.

Pernicious anemia is a macrocytic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency that is due to lack of intrinsic factor. Low vitamin
B12 intake, gastrectomy, diseases of the small intestine, malabsorption, and transcobalamin deficiency can also cause vitamin
Bi2 deficiency.",200,1100,147.56,811.58,545,1100,402.1,811.58,pg/mL,pmol/L,"Insufficient B12 Intake

surgery, pacreatic insufficiency.","Functional B12 Deficiency Marked by Inadequate Uptake at the Tissue Level

anemia, scurvy, atherosclerosis, mood disorders, impaired wound healing, and other significant health issues.","Vitamin C is involved in numerous functions in the body including collagen production and maintenance; carnitine synthesis
and energy metabolism; wound healing; drug metabolism; antioxidant protection; prevention of lipid peroxidation; prevention
of protein glycosylation; modulation of inflammation; enhancement of arterial dilation via nitric oxide; production of bile acids
from cholesterol; absorption of non-heme iron in plant-based foods; activation of folate; and neurotransmitter synthesis
including conversion of tryptophan to serotonin and metabolism of dopamine and norepinephrine.

The highest concentrations are found in the brain, the eye, and the adrenal glands. Blood levels of vitamin C are inversely
related to all-cause mortality.

Fruits and vegetables are the best dietary sources of vitamin C though additional supplementation is common.

Elevated levels

Blood levels of vitamin C exceeding the maximum achieved with the dietary intake (4 mg/dL) or levels achieved with IV
vitamin C (350 mg/dL) may be considered elevated. Individuals with oxalate kidney stones, hemochromatosis, and glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency need to restrict supplemental vitamin C.

Decreased levels

Low levels of vitamin C are associated with vitamin C deficiency, most frequently seen in chronic disease, major depression,
hospitalization, after surgery, and in smokers. Consequences of vitamin C insufficiency include blood vessel fragility;
compromised connective tissue and wound healing; scurvy, bleeding gums, and skin; increased oxidative stress and glycation;
fatigue, weakness, and depression; aching joints, bones, and muscles.

Blood levels of vitamin C should be assessed in those with inadequate dietary intake, chronic musculoskeletal complaints, poor
wound healing, depression, bleeding gums, and other signs and symptoms of scurvy. Low levels of vitamin C are common in
institutionalized elderly, lower-income individuals, gastrointestinal disorders, those with impaired chewing ability, and patients
on chemotherapy. Anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, depression, and alcohol abuse increase the risk of vitamin C deficiency.
Vitamin C should not be supplemented in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency unless medically
supervised.",0.2,2.7,11.36,153.31,1.3,4,73.81,227.12,mg/dL,umol/L,"Decreased Levels Associated with:

Vitamin D (25-OH),"This vitamin D test measures for levels of 25-OH vitamin D and is an exceptionally good way to assess vitamin D status. An
increased serum vitamin D is usually seen with patients that are supplementing with too much vitamin D. A decreased serum
vitamin D is extremely common and is a sign of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with many
disorders including many forms of cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammation, chronic pain, mental
illness including depression, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis to name just a few.","Vitamin D acts to increase calcium levels in the blood by enhancing calcium uptake from the gut, mobilizing calcium from
tissues, and reducing fecal and urinary calcium loss.

25, Hydroxy Vitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) is currently the test to use to diagnose vitamin D deficiency. Although you can
measure 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D, this does not tell you about deficiency, so don't order the wrong test. 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin
D is an adaptive hormone that goes up and down with calcium intake. This test is often normal and doctors tell their patients
that their vitamin D levels are ok when they are really deficient.

Here are some quotes about serum Vitamin D testing from Alan Gaby, M.D., a renowned Functional Medicine Expert:
“Metallurgically speaking, the reliability of serum 25(OH)D as an indicator of vitamin D status might more aptly be
characterized as bronze, rather than gold, even though it is currently the best assessment method available.”

“One problem with this test is that substantial variations have been encountered from one laboratory to another and with the
use of different methods of assessment.”

“Another complicating factor is that 25(OH)D is only one of more than 50 vitamin D metabolites that have been identified.”
“Although little is known about many of these metabolites, at least one (not including 1,.25{OH]2D) appears to have biological
activity...”

“It would not be surprising if some of these compounds were able to bind to vitamin D receptors or to compete with vitamin
D, 25(COH)DD, or 1.25 (OH)2D as substrates for enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism.”

VLDL Cholesterol,"VLDL is a lipoprotein formed in the liver to transport endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, protein, and cholesterol. it
serves, from a functional perspective, as an internal lipid transport molecule, moving triglyceride and other lipids from one area
of the body to another.","Once VLDL is released into the blood stream, lipoprotein lipase removes the triglyceride and the molecule is converted into
Low Density Lipoproteins or LDL. VLDL, because it transports cholesterol and triglycerides in the body, is considered a “bad”
cholesterol.",0,30,0,0.78,0,15,0,0.39,mg/dL,mmol/L,,"Increased risk of heart disease and stroke
An increased VLDL level is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.",,,,,,,
VLDL Size (NMR),"VLDL Size is a measurement of the size of the VLDL particles. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is a triglyceride-rich
lipoprotein. It undergoes modification in circulation to eventually become LDL as it “drops off” its triglyceride cargo. Larger
VLDL particles carry more triglycerides than smaller VLDL particles. A larger VLDL size is associated with cardiometabolic risk
even if total triglycerides aren’t elevated.","VLDL is 60-70% triglyceride by composition. Having a core rich in triglycerides makes VLDL buoyant. VLDL also carries
cholesterol (-10% of its lipid composition). Approximately 10-15% of circulating blood cholesterol is carried on VLDL.

VLDL can be estimated using serum triglyceride levels when TGs are below 400 mg/dl (4.5 mmol/L).

However, estimated VLDL levels cannot differentiate between large and small VLDL. Therefore, direct measurement is needed
to best assess disease risk.

Decreased intake and absorption will lead to zinc depietion and reduced RBC zinc. Levels decline more gradually with
marginal insufficiency. Zinc absorption may be decreased when consumed with iron, magnesium, calcium, phytates, oxalates.
Excess copper levels will reduce zinc absorption and retention. The heavy metal cadmium can also inhibit zinc absorption.
When zinc intake and total body content decreases, the plasma, bone, liver, and testes will lose proportionately more zinc than
other tissues such as the heart, skin, and skeletal muscle.

Hypochlorhydria

Zinc is part of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme which facilitates production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Low zinc levels
and zinc deficiency are associated with decreased activity of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, resulting in alterations in oxygen
and carbon dioxide metabolism and hydrochloric acid production.

Immune Compromise

Zinc deficiency will negatively affect immunity and increase susceptibility to pathogenic infection.

Maldigestion and malabsorption

Zinc deficiency can contribute to impaired protein digestion and contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea.
Zinc absorption can be reduced when bound to phytates in whole grains.

Hyperlipidemia

Low RBC zinc is associated with increased blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Inflammatory process

The body will decrease serum zinc and increase serum copper during inflammation or an acute phase of disease. Zinc helps
control oxidative stress, regulates inflammatory cytokines, and targets pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB. A deficiency of zinc
contributes to increased inflammation and tissue damage.

Metabolic syndrome

Zinc has a pivotal role in insulin metabolism and its association with metabolic syndrome is being researched. Current results
suggest that low serum zinc is associated with increased fasting insulin and the association becomes stronger as the number
of metabolic syndrome risk factors increases.

Thyroid Disease

RBC zinc may be decreased in hyperthyroidism (i.e. Graves’ disease) even if serum levels are within normal limits. Levels may
be reduced in hypothyroidism but not to the same degree as in hyperthyroidism.

Antioxidant insufficiency

Low RBC zinc associated with reduced levels of RBC copper-zinc superoxide dismutase which in turn can reduce antioxidant
activity within the cell.","Zinc supplementation

Serum zinc concentrations will rise with supplementation and may exceed optimal levels although associated toxicity is rare.
Oral contraceptives

Elevations in RBC zinc may be seen with oral contraceptives.

Copper deficiency

Excess zinc supplementation can reduce copper absorption and induce a deficiency. It is helpful to monitor serum copper
levels as well as the copper: zinc ratio.

Environmental exposure

Inhalation of zinc (e.g. during welding, plating, etc.) can lead to toxicity characterized by pale mucous membranes, jaundice,
Heinz bodies, anemia, impaired glutathione activity. Metal fume fever caused by zinc inhalation may manifest as a cough,
