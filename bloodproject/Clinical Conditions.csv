Adrenal Function,"The Adrenal Function score reflects the degree of function in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce hormones in
response to stress, “the fight or flight response”. Unfortunately, when the body is under constant stress, which is very common,
the adrenal glands become less functional. Adrenal dysfunction can be caused by an increased output of stress hormones
(adrenal stress) or more commonly a decreased output of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency).","« Irritability

© Adrenal Insufficiency (Adrenal hypofunction)
© Adrenal Stress (hyperadrenalism)","

In Functional Medicine, the focus is on holistic treatment strategies addressing lifestyle, diet, and stress management:

• Diet: Incorporate a nutrient-rich diet focusing on vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limiting caffeine and sugar can help regulate cortisol levels.

• Lifestyle modifications: Prioritize sleep and incorporate regular relaxation practices to manage stress, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.

• Exercise: Moderate exercise can help balance cortisol levels, but overtraining should be avoided as it can stress the adrenals further.

• Nutritional supplements: Adaptogens like ashwagandha, rhodiola, and holy basil may support adrenal function. Vitamins C and B5, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids can also support adrenal health.

• Herbal support: Licorice (in non-hypertensive patients) can prolong the half-life of cortisol, providing adrenal support.

Management of adrenal dysfunction requires a comprehensive approach, considering individual health status and specific symptoms. Please review the individual sections in the Clinical Conditions Guide for Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Stress for ways to treat these conditions."
addrenal insufficiency ,"Adrenal insufficiency is also known as adrenal hypofunction or adrenal fatigue. It is a later stage of decompensation of the
adrenal glands. [t sets in when the stressors continue to act on the body, which can no longer react, causing decreased
cortisol and DHEA output.
This stage has the following characteristics:
e The sympathetic nervous system continues to respond to the stressors and continues to cause the release of
catecholamines (Epinephrine and Norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla.
e The catecholamines continue to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary system causing the continued release of ACTH.
e In the fatigue stage the hypothalamus-pituitary system is barely sensitive to the presence of cortisol.
e ACTH levels continue to stay high and continue to stimulate the adrenal glands. The adrenal cortex, at this stage, is so
fatigued that it can no longer respond to ACTH stimulation, causing a dramatic decrease in the secretion of hormones.
e Free cortisol is decreased and DHEA is normal or decreased, which leads to a decreased cortisol/DHEA ratio.","« Irritability

• Diet
• Whole Foods: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins.
• Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates: Minimize intake to reduce adrenal strain.
• Alcohol: Limit or avoid to support adrenal health.
• Protein: Ensure adequate intake at every meal to support energy levels and repair.
• Caffeine: Reduce or eliminate to decrease adrenal stress.
• Food Allergens: Identify and avoid to prevent immune system activation and adrenal stress. Consider food sensitivity testing.
• Detoxification Diets: Exercise caution with fasting and detox diets, as they can stress the adrenals if not supervised by a healthcare professional.
• Nutritional/Botanical Support Adrenal Supplements:
• Use targeted supplements for treating the adrenals that are available from physician-only nutraceutical companies
• Ginseng: Supports adrenal function, enhances stress resistance, and can protect against adrenal atrophy. Recommended dose: 100 mg twice daily.
• Licorice: Increases adrenal hormone levels, beneficial for low cortisol states. Use deglycyrrhizinated licorice to avoid potential side effects. Recommended dose: 2 capsules three times a day.
• Stress Management
• Sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours starting before 10:00 p.m. to maximize adrenal restoration. Consider short naps if needed, without disrupting nighttime sleep.
• Relaxation Techniques: Engage in breathing exercises, meditation, biofeedback, or other relaxation methods regularly.
• Support Systems: Embrace nurturing relationships and activities that bring joy and laughter.
• Professional Support: Seek counseling or therapy to manage stressors effectively.
• Exercise
• Moderation is Key: Engage in light to moderate exercise without overexerting. Start slowly and gradually increase intensity based on comfort and energy levels.
• Exposure to Natural Light
• Outdoor Time: Spend time outdoors daily to benefit from natural light, even on cloudy days.
• Full-Spectrum Lighting: Use full-spectrum bulbs in living and workspaces to mimic natural light, supporting circadian rhythms and adrenal health.
• Additional Considerations
• Hydration: Maintain adequate hydration levels, as dehydration can stress the adrenals.
• Salt Intake: For those with low blood pressure or who feel better with a bit more salt, consider adding a small amount of high-quality salt to the diet, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
• Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Include sources of omega-3s, such as fish or flaxseed oil, to support anti-inflammatory pathways and overall health.
• Mindful Eating: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues to avoid overeating or undereating, both of which can stress the body.
Incorporating these measures can support adrenal health and overall well-being."
Adrenal Stress,"Stress refers to anything that disturbs an individual's physical, mental, or emotional equilibrium. The body has numerous stress
response mechanisms and stress can affect the body in many different ways.
In fact, the same form of stress might cause one individual to get a migraine, a second person to have an ulcer attack, and a
third to have elevated blood pressure. It is important to realize that stress is not all bad. Stress is a normal part of life. What
matters is how much stress, what kind of stress, and ultimately, how each individual handles his or her stresses.
The adrenals have a hard time interpreting ""bad"" stress, as described above, or good stress, such as the adrenaline rush of
skiing down a big mountain. The adrenals deal with stress through the production of the hormones cortisol and DHEA. We
evolved to be able to use our adrenal glands to help us deal with short-term stress. If we live in stress for long periods of time.
we begin to lose the ability to keep up with the stress and begin to function as if the adrenals are fatigued.
Adrenal Hyperfunction sets in when the above stressors are not removed, and the cortisol tevels remain high in relation to the
DHEA levels. This stage has the following characteristics:
e The sympathetic nervous system still responds to the stressors and continues to cause the release of catecholamines
(Epinephrine and Norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla.
e The catecholamines stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary system causing the continued release of ACTH
e ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex causing the release of cortisol and increases the levels of free cortisol in the body
e The hypothalamic-pituitary system normally responds to increased cortisol levels by decreasing ACTH output. In the
compensation stage hypothalamus-pituitary system begins to get insensitive to the presence of cortisol and cortisol
levels continue to stay high.
e DHEA levels, instead of rising like the cortisol, remain normal or show no signs of increase leading to an increased
cortisol/DHEA ratio that is out of balance.
e cortisol leads to adrenal hyperfunctioning.
e Decompensation begins to occur as the levels of DHEA begin to decrease due the failure of the adrenal cortex to
produce DHEA upon ACTH stimulation.","« Decreased insulin sensitivity leading to increased insulin resistance

of adrenal insufficiency, requires a nuanced approach. The following aims to support the adrenals by mitigating stress before it
progresses to insufficiency or exhaustion. Here’s a plan for addressing adrenal stress:
e Diet Modifications
© Balanced Nutrient Intake: Focus on a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats to
stabilize blood sugar and support adrenal function.
° Complex Carbohydrates: Include whole grains and legumes to provide steady energy and support serotonin
production, which can help in stress management.
° Magnesium-Rich Foods: Incorporate green leafy vegetables, nuts, and seeds to support the stress response, as
magnesium can help relax the nervous system.
o Regular, Balanced Meats: Eat reguiar meals and snacks to maintain blood sugar levels, preventing additional stress
on the adrenals.
e Nutritional/Botanical Support
o Vitamin C: Vital for adrenal gland function; include foods high in vitamin C or consider supplementation.
o B-Vitamins: Especially BS (pantothenic acid), B6, and B12, are crucial for energy production and managing stress;
found in whole grains, eggs, and meat.
e Adaptogens: Herbs like Rhodiola, Ashwagandha, and Holy Basil help the body resist and adapt to stress without
directly stimulating the adrenals.
o Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Support mood regulation and anti-inflammatory responses; include fish oil or flaxseed
supplements.
e Stress Management Techniques
o Mindfulness and Meditation: Encourage practices that promote present-moment awareness to reduce stress
perception.
o Deep Breathing Exercises: Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing help activate the parasympathetic nervous
system, reducing stress response.
o Yoga and Tai Chi: Gentle movements combined with breath work can reduce stress and improve resilience.
° Time Management: Encourage effective time management to reduce overwhelm and stress levels.
e Exercise Recommendations
o Gentle Exercise: Encourage activities like walking, yoga, or swimming, which can reduce stress without
overburdening the adrenals.
o Consistent, Moderate Activity: Regular, moderate exercise can improve stress resilience, mood, and overall health.
° Avoid High-Intensity Workouts: During periods of high stress, intense workouts may further stress the adrenals.
Recommend moderating exercise intensity.
e Natural Light and Sleep Optimization
o Regular Sleep Schedule: Encourage going to bed and waking up at the same time every day to support circadian
rhythm and adrenal health.
o Reduce Blue Light Exposure: Limit screen time before bed to support melatonin production and improve sleep
quality.
° Sleep Environment: Recommend creating a restful sleep environment—cool, dark, and quiet—to enhance sleep
quality.
e Additional Lifestyle Adjustments
o Hydration: Emphasize the importance of staying well-hydrated as dehydration can elevate stress levels.
° Limit Stimulants: Reduce intake of caffeine and other stimulants that can exacerbate stress responses.
© Social Support: Encourage building a supportive social network to share burdens and reduce stress through
connection.
By incorporating these strategies, you can offer a comprehensive plan to support individuals experiencing adrenal stress,
helping to restore balance and prevent progression to adrenal insufficiency."
Allergy,"A general tendency towards allergies indicates a hyperreactive immune response to harmless substances, such as certain
foods, pollen, dust mites, mold, and pet dander. This hyperreactivity can manifest as various allergic conditions, including

e Allergy testing: blood tests (specific IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies), and oral food challenges.
e Elimination diets and food challenges: Particularly for identifying food allergies.
e Assessment of gut health: Identifying dysbiosis or leaky gut, which can contribute to allergic sensitivities.","Here are some of the common causes of allergy and sensitivities:
1. Earty exposure to allergens in utero.
2. Early exposure to allergens as an infant.
3. Poor digestion of foods with a possible hypochlorhydria or pancreatic insufficiency causing dysbiosis and intestinal
hyperpermeability leading to the absorption of macromolecules to which the body becomes sensitized.
4. Frequent exposure to the same allergens or foods.
5. Decreased mucosal secretory IgA.
6. Increased stress causing a decrease in adrenal function
7. Increased exposure to various environmental toxins and allergens.
All of the above increase the body's sensitivity to allergens.","Some of the disorders associated with Allergies include:
1. Allergic Rhinitis (Hayfever)
2. Asthma
3. Eczema (atopic dermatitis)
4. Chronic sinusitis
5. Food allergies and intolerances","The following recommendations are for patients suffering from allergies, which may be seasonal or food allergies.

e Diet: The best diet for your patient is the hypoatlergenic diet that is part of the Food Elimination and Challenge
Program. Follow that program to clear all allergens from the diet and then challenge suspected allergenic foods.

e Optimal Bowel Transit: Adequate elimination is essential to reduce the allergenic load on the body. Use the Bowel
Transit Time Test from Dr. Weatherby's Take Home Testing Book to see whether they have an optimal bowel transit.
Consider bentonite clay, psytlium powder, magnesium, or herbal bitters to correct an abnormal bowel transit.

e Improve digestion: Assess the patient's digestive function and supplement with HCL and pancreatic enzymes if needed.
Encourage them to eat slowly and chew food well.

e Improve bowel flora: Supplement with probiotics if needed.

e Remove allergens from their environment: Encourage the use of a HEPA filtration system or air purifier to reduce the
body's burden of allergens, improving resistance to environmental allergens and foods.

e Antioxidants: Antioxidants will strengthen cell walls and help stabilize mast celis from releasing their cytotoxic content.

¢ Individual Nutrients:

o Vitamin E: Strengthens cell membranes, has ceil membrane tightening properties, and stimulates anti-
inflammatory activity.

° Selenium: Involved in the synthesis of glutathione in the liver

o Vitamin C: Acts as a natural antihistamine with doses greater than 6-8 grams.

° Bioflavonoids: Bioflavonoids such as quercetin, hesperidin, and catechin have the following anti-allergy functions
in the body:

s Decrease the degranulation of mast cells
= Inhibit lipoxygenase, phospholipase, and phosphodiesterase
s Catechin inhibits histamine decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for converting histidine to histamine.
e Assess and Support Adrenal Function: Consider running an Adrenal Stress Index to assess for cortisol/DHEA ratios and
to check for total secretory IgA levels.
e Stress management, vitamin C, pantothenic acid, and adrenal glandular all have therapeutic effects on the adrenals.
e Recommend some form of physical activity, which will decrease stress.
Treatment Options for Sensitivities
This is a brief overview of some treatment options for patients with known dust, mold, and food sensitivities.
Avoid your known allergens - food and environmental
e Recommend a HEPA air filter, especially in the bedroom
e Molds - have the patient use a bleach 1:5 dilution and clean bathroom windows, tiles, etc., monthly. Recommend they
keep house temperature at 70 degrees for 8 hours a day and they should keep no books in the bedroom because they
are a source of mold.
e Dust—We recommend using a hypoallergenic mattress cover and not having throw rugs in the house. They should
vacuum or damp mop the floors at least three times a week and not have stuffed animals in the bedroom.
e Food - recommend the Food Elimination and Challenge Program

¢ Regularly change filters on your forced air heating system.
Improve immune balance and adrenal function.
e Lower physical and emotional stressors
e Establish a regular sleep and eating pattern
e Use nutritional supplements as needed based on testing
Improve digestion and pancreatic function.
e Assess Gl and supplement as appropriate to correct hypochlorhydria and pancreatic insufficiency.
Improve bowel function, so the patient has proper elimination daily
« Recommend high-fiber foods
e Recommend they drink sufficient quantities of clean, pure water
Note: One of the best ways of treating allergies and sensitivities is to treat the underlying gastrointestinal dysfunction."

e Lifestyle factors: Poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption.
e Genetic predisposition","Atherosclerosis is associated with an increased risk of:
« Coronary artery disease (CAD)
« Cerebrovascular disease
« Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
« Chronic kidney disease","Functional Medicine strategies for managing a trend towards atherosclerosis focus on lifestyle interventions, dietary
modifications, and targeted supplementation:

« Dietary modifications: Emphasize a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats
(particularity omega-3 fatty acids). Reduce intake of processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats.

« Physical activity: Regular exercise improves lipid profiles, lowers blood pressure, and reduces inflammation. Weight
management: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.
Smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake.

« Stress management: Techniques such as meditation, yoga, and mindfulness can reduce stress-induced inflammation.

« Supplementation: Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants (vitamins C and E), magnesium, and other nutrients can support
arterial health. Niacin and plant sterols may also help manage lipid levels.

« Address underlying conditions: Optimize contro! of hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions contributing to
atherosclerosis risk.

status. Collaboration with cardiologists for those at high risk or with established heart disease may be needed. Regular
monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors and adjustments to lifestyle and treatment plans is essential to effectively manage the
trend towards atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events."
Bacterial Infection,"Bacterial infections result from the invasion and proliferation of bacteria in or on the body, leading to various diseases, from
localized skin infections to systemic conditions such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and sepsis. Functional
Medicine approaches bacterial infections by addressing the underlying causes of susceptibility, supporting the body's immune
defenses, and, when necessary, using antibiotics judiciously alongside supportive natural therapies to minimize adverse effects
and prevent recurrence.","« Fever and chills
« Redness, swelling, and warmth at the infection site
« Pus or discharge from an infection site

« Pus or discharge from an infection site
« Pain or tenderness
« Fatigue and malaise
« Cough, sore throat, or difficulty breathing in respiratory infections
« Urinary symptoms in UTIs, such as urgency, frequency, and pain","Assessing for bacterial infections depends on whether the infection is acute, chronic, or recovering, plus an examination of
possible infection sites:
« Clinical examination: To assess symptoms and possible infection sites.
« Assessments for Acute Bacterial Infection:
« Neutrophils will tend to be increased. They are the primary cell type for fighting bacterial infections.
« Expect a decreased or normal lymphocyte count
« Total WBC count may be elevated
« An increase in bands, which are young non-segmented neutrophils or metamyelocytes occurs with acute
infection, with or without an absolute increase in the total WBC
« This is known as a “shift to the left""
« The presence of bands can help determine the timing or severity of an infection.
° They will increase in active infection and normalize in the recovery phase
« Band cells in a bacterial infection can often be a good prognosis.
« An increased neutrophils count and normal lymphocytes = an acute bacterial picture.
« Assessments for Chronic Bacterial Infection
« An increased neutrophil count is seen along with a decreased WBC
« A chronic infection of unknown cause (i.e. not sure if it is bacterial or viral) can use up a large number of
lymphocytes, which may be decreased
« Expect to see increased monocytes in the recovery phase.
« Recovery Phase of an Infection
« Monocytes will often be elevated in the recovery phase of an infection and can be used to follow the course of an
infection
« Monocytes are phagocytic cells that are capable of movement and remove dead cells, microorganisms, and
particulate matter from circulating blood.
« During an infectious process, the monocyte level will increase after about 3 days to phagocytize fragments of
neutrophils.
« Monocytes also produce the antiviral agent interferon.
« It is a positive sign to see an increase in Monocytes towards the end of an infection
« Imaging, such as X-rays or CT scans, to detect internal infections.","The cause of a bacterial infection is usually exposure to the pathogenic bacteria. Still, from a functional medicine perspective,
we must also consider what makes the body more susceptible to bacterial infections.

dietary habits. Collaboration with gastroenterologists may be needed for complex cases. Regular follow-up is essential to
monitor symptoms, adjust dietary and supplement interventions, and manage any complications arising from impaired bile
flow or associated conditions."
Biliary Obstruction,"Biliary obstruction, or bile duct obstruction, occurs when there is a blockage in the bile ducts that prevents bile from flowing
from the liver to the gallbladder and into the small intestine. Bile is crucial for digesting fats and eliminating waste products,
including bilirubin, from the body. Obstruction can lead to jaundice, pain, and potentially severe liver damage if left untreated.

Blood Sugar Regulation,"The Blood Sugar Regulation score shows whether or not there is dysfunction in this patient’s blood sugar regulation. Blood
sugar dysregulation doesn’t suddenly emerge but develops slowly, so we can look for clues in the blood test that can help us
determine if there’s dysregulation and, if so, what it is.
Blood sugar dysregulation encompasses a spectrum of disorders, including insulin resistance, hypoglycemia, and diabetes
(Type 1, Type 2, and gestational). These conditions involve an imbalance in glucose levels and insulin action in the body,
leading to too high or too low blood sugar levels. Proper management is crucial as dysregulation can lead to severe
complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, kidney damage, and eye problems.
Some conditions associated with blood sugar dysregulation include:

e Insulin Resistance (early stage) and glucose intolerance

e Early stage of Hyperglycemia/Diabetes

Calcium Need,"There is a predominant belief that calcium deficiency is very common and that most patients would benefit from daily
supplementation. Clinical experience suggests that a calcium need has less to do with calcium deficiency and more to do with
an inability to absorb and utilize dietary calcium. Rule out hypochlorhydria, the need for magnesium, phosphorous, vitamin A,
B and C, unsaturated fatty acids, and iodine as some of the reasons for a “calcium” need, before supplementing with calcium.
When subjective indicators or lab testing identify a potential calcium need, the lack of synergistic co-factors that aid in
calcium metabolism is often the main problem.","« Muscle cramps at rest
« Frequent nose bleeds
« Soft fingernails

5. High or low biood pressure.
6. Irritability
7. Fever with a mild cold or virus
8. Frequent hoarseness","Diagnosing calcium deficiency, or hypocalcemia, typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, blood tests, and
sometimes imaging studies.

1. Medical history and physical examination: Take a detailed medical history to understand your symptoms, risk factors,
and any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to calcium deficiency. They will also perform a physical
examination to check for signs such as muscle cramps, numbness, and muscle spasms.

2. Blood tests: Blood tests are crucial for diagnosing calcium deficiency. The following blood tests are commonly used:

© Total calcium levels

© lonized calcium levels

e Albumin levels

© Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels

3. Urine tests: In some cases, your healthcare provider may order a 24-hour urine collection to measure the amount of
calcium excreted in your urine. This can heip determine if your kidneys are properly reabsorbing calcium.

4. Imaging studies: In certain situations, imaging studies like X-rays or bone density scans (DEXA scans) may be used to
assess bone health and identify conditions like osteoporosis, which can be related to long-term calcium deficiency.

5. Evaluation of underlying causes: Some additional tests may be needed to find the underlying cause, such as vitamin D
deficiency, kidney disease, or gastrointestinal disorders. Additional tests may be needed to pinpoint the specific reason
for the deficiency.","Here are some common causes of calcium deficiency:

1. Inadequate dietary intake: A diet lacking in calcium-rich foods, such as dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified foods,
can lead to calcium deficiency. This is especially common in individuals who have restricted diets, such as vegans or
those with lactose intolerance.

2. Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium in the intestines. If you don't get enough
sunlight (which helps your body produce vitamin D) or have a condition that impairs vitamin D absorption, it can lead to
calcium deficiency.

3. Malabsorption disorders: Conditions that affect the absorption of nutrients in the digestive tract, such as celiac disease,
Crohn’s disease, and certain surgical procedures like gastric bypass surgery, can result in calcium deficiency.

4. Kidney problems: The kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining calcium balance in the body. Kidney diseases or
disorders that affect their function can lead to calcium imbalances.

5. Medications: Some medications, like certain diuretics, anticonvulsants, and glucocorticoids, can interfere with calcium
absorption or increase calcium excretion, potentially leading to deficiency.

6. Hormonal changes: Hormonal imbalances, such as parathyroid gland disorders (e.g., hypoparathyroidism) or thyroid
disorders, can disrupt calcium regulation in the body.

7. Aging: As people age, their bodies may become less efficient at absorbing calcium from the diet, which can increase the
risk of deficiency.

8. Alcohol and caffeine consumption: Excessive consumption of alcohol or caffeine can interfere with calcium absorption
in the intestines.

9. Certain medical treatments: Some medical treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can affect the
body's ability to absorb or utilize calcium.

10. Genetic factors: Rare genetic conditions, like familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, can predispose individuals to calcium
imbalances.","Calcium deficiency (hypocalcemia) can be associated with various medical conditions and diseases, as it plays a vital role in
numerous physiological processes in the body. Here are some diseases and conditions that can be linked to or affected by
calcium deficiency:

1. Osteoporosis: Calcium deficiency over a prolonged period can lead to reduced bone density, making bones weaker and
more susceptible to fractures. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by fragile and brittle bones, and it is a major
consequence of chronic calcium deficiency.

2. Rickets: Rickets is a condition primarily seen in children and is characterized by weakened and deformed bones. It is
often caused by severe vitamin D deficiency, which impairs calcium absorption in the intestines.

3. Hypoparathyroidism: This is a condition where the parathyroid glands produce insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH).
PTH is essential for maintaining calcium levels in the blood. Low PTH levels can result in low blood calcium levels and
lead to symptoms of calcium deficiency.

4. Chronic kidney disease: Kidneys play a crucial role in regulating calcium balance in the body. In chronic kidney disease
(CKD), the kidneys may not function properly, leading to calcium imbalances and hypocalcemia.

5. Malabsorption disorders: Conditions like celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and certain surgical procedures that affect the
absorption of nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract can lead to calcium deficiency.

6. Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis can cause calcium to bind with fatty acids in the blood, leading to calcium deposits and
reduced levels of ionized calcium in the bloodstream.

7. Hypomagnesemia: Low levels of magnesium in the body can disrupt calcium balance, as magnesium is necessary for the
proper functioning of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and for calcium metabolism.

8. Preeclampsia and eclampsia: During pregnancy, inadequate calcium intake can contribute to the development of
preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy) and, in severe cases, eclampsia, which is characterized by
seizures.

9. Alkalosis: Metabolic alkalosis is a condition in which the body’s pH becomes too alkaline. This can lead to symptoms of
hypocalcemia, as it can cause calcium to bind to albumin more tightly, reducing the amount of ionized calcium available
in the blood.

10. Medications and treatments: Some medications, such as diuretics and certain cancer treatments, can affect calcium
levels in the body and contribute to hypocalcemia as a side effect.

It’s important to note that while calcium deficiency can contribute to or exacerbate these conditions, addressing the
underlying cause of the deficiency is essential for effective treatment.","The treatment of calcium deficiency, or hypocalcemia, depends on its underlying cause, severity, and individual patient factors.
Here are some general approaches to treating calcium deficiency:
1. Dietary changes:

° Increase calcium intake: Incorporate calcium-rich foods into your diet, such as dairy products (if tolerated), leafy
green vegetables (e.g., kale, collard greens), fortified foods (e.g., fortified orange juice, fortified cereals), tofu,
almonds, and sardines

° Consider calcium supplements

2. Vitamin D supplementation:
Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium in the intestines. If you have a vitamin D deficiency, your healthcare
provider may recommend vitamin D supplements. The specific dose will depend on your vitamin D levels and individual
needs.
3. Treating undertying medical conditions:
If an underlying medical condition is causing the calcium deficiency, such as kidney disease or parathyroid gland
disorders, treatment of that condition is essential. Managing the underlying cause may help normalize calcium levels.
4. Medication adjustments:
If medications are contributing to calcium deficiency, your healthcare provider may consider adjusting or discontinuing
those medications if possible. However, any medication changes should be made under medical supervision.
5. Intravenous calcium therapy:
In severe cases of acute hypocalcemia or when oral supplementation is not possible, intravenous (IV) calcium therapy
may be necessary. This is typically reserved for emergencies and is administered in a hospital setting.

6. Monitor and follow-up:
Regular monitoring of calcium levels through blood tests is important to track your progress and adjust treatment as
needed. Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate frequency of follow-up tests.

7. Lifestyle modifications:
Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including regular weight-bearing exercise and avoiding excessive alcohol and caffeine
consumption, can support bone health and calcium absorption."
Carbohydrate Status,"Carbohydrate imbalances, particularly related to excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates, can lead to blood sugar
dysregulation and associated health issues. Refined carbohydrates include sugars and grains that have been processed,
removing fiber, vitamins, and minerals. This processing results in foods that are quickly digested and absorbed, leading to

Copper Need,"Copper deficiency in humans is relatively rare but can occur in certain conditions. Typically, a well-balanced diet provides
enough copper for the body’s needs. However, certain medical conditions, surgical procedures, or poor diet can result ina
deficiency. Copper is a trace mineral essential for the proper functioning of the body. It plays a pivotal role in:
1. Enzyme Activity Many enzymes require copper to function. These enzymes are involved in critical biological processes
like energy production, iron metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis.
2. Connective Tissue Formation: Copper is essential for the synthesis of collagen and elastin, which provide strength and
elasticity to skin, bones, and blood vessels.
3. Central Nervous System: Copper is necessary for the production and function of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals
that transmit messages within the brain.
4. lron Metabolism: Copper helps with the transport of iron, and a deficiency might lead to iron-related disorders.","« Anemia: A reduced number of red blood cells, often leading to fatigue and paleness.
« Neuropathy: Neurological problems that can manifest as numbness or tingling in the extremities, weakness, and coordination difficulties.
« Bone and Joint Issues: Weakened bones can lead to osteoporosis, and joints might become more susceptible to osteoarthritis.
« Fatigue and Weakness: Due to disrupted energy production.
« Immune System Dysfunction: Reduced copper can compromise the immune system, leading to frequent infections.
« Skin Abnormalities: Loss of pigment, sores, or brittle hair can be indicative of a deficiency.","When copper levels are insufficient, one might experience:
1. Anemia: A reduced number of red blood cells, often leading to fatigue and paleness.
2. Neuropathy: Neurological problems that can manifest as numbness or tingling in the extremities, weakness, and
coordination difficulties.
3. Bone and Joint Issues: Weakened bones can lead to osteoporosis, and joints might become more susceptible to
osteoarthritis.
4. Fatigue and Weakness: Due to disrupted energy production.
5. Immune System Dysfunction: Reduced copper can compromise the immune system, leading to frequent infections.
6. Skin Abnormalities: Loss of pigment, sores, or brittle hair can be indicative of a deficiency.
While copper deficiency is not common, its impact on human heatth is significant, given copper’s multifaceted role in human
physiology. Regular monitoring and a balanced diet usually prevent the adverse effects of this deficiency.","Diagnosing copper deficiency typically involves a combination of clinical assessment, review of medical and dietary history,
and laboratory testing. Here are some common methods used to diagnose copper deficiency:

1. Clinical Assessment: The initial step involves a thorough evaluation of symptoms and signs suggestive of copper
deficiency, such as anemia, neuropathy, or skeletal abnormalities.

2. Dietary and Medical History: Understanding a patient’s dietary habits, supplement intake, history of surgeries (especially
gastric surgeries), and medication use can provide valuable clues. For instance, excessive zinc or prolonged use of
proton pump inhibitors might be relevant to the diagnosis.

3. Serum Copper Levels: This is a direct measure of the amount of copper in the blood. Decreased serum copper levels can
indicate a deficiency.

4. Serum Ceruloplasmin Levels: Ceruioplasmin is a copper-carrying protein in the blood. While its levels can provide
insight, they are not always directly indicative of overall copper status. For instance, ceruloplasmin can be elevated in
inflammatory conditions regardless of copper status.

5. 24-Hour Urinary Copper Excretion: This measures the amount of copper excreted in the urine over a day. It’s particularly
helpful when assessing conditions like Wilson’s disease, where copper accumulation in the body might be a concern.

6. Complete Blood Count (CBC): Anemia with characteristic changes in red blood cell morphology can be suggestive of
copper deficiency.

7. Bone Marrow Examination: In severe or unclear cases, a bone marrow biopsy might show changes consistent with
copper deficiency, such as ringed sideroblasts, which are abnormal precursors to red blood cells.

8. Neurological Examinations: If neurological symptoms are present, additional tests like nerve conduction studies or MRI
might be used to evaluate the extent and nature of any neuropathies or other neurological involvement.

9. Liver Function Tests: In situations where Wilson's disease or other liver conditions are suspected, tests to evaluate liver
function can be helpful.
10. Genetic Testing: For conditions like Menkes disease or Wilson’s disease, genetic testing might be used to confirm the
diagnosis.
In any case, if copper deficiency is suspected, it is essential to approach the diagnosis comprehensively, looking at the
complete clinical picture, as other conditions can mimic or coexist with copper deficiency. Once diagnosed, the underlying
cause should be determined and addressed to ensure effective treatment and prevent recurrence.","Copper deficiency can arise from various causes, many of which impact the absorption, utilization, or storage of copper in the
body. Some of the common causes include:

1. Poor Dietary Intake: A diet lacking in copper-rich foods, such as shellfish, nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans, and organ
meats, can lead to a deficiency over time.

2. Malabsorption Syndromes: Conditions that hinder the absorption of nutrients in the smail intestine, such as celiac
disease, Crohn's disease, or atrophic gastritis, can reduce copper absorption.

3. Excessive Zinc Supplementation: High doses of zinc can interfere with copper absorption in the intestines. Over time,
this can lead to a copper deficiency.

4. Menkes Disease: This is a rare inherited disorder that affects copper levels in the body. Affected individuals have
difficulty transporting and utilizing copper properly.

5. Prolonged Parenteral Nutrition: Individuals who rely on intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition) for extended periods
can become copper deficient if the solution does not provide adequate copper.

6. Gastric Bypass Surgery: Some types of weight-loss surgeries, especially those that bypass portions of the stomach and
small intestine, can reduce the absorption of copper and other essential nutrients.

7. Medications: Some medications can interfere with copper absorption or metabolism. For example, proton pump
inhibitors, which reduce stomach acid, can affect copper absorption.

8. Wilson’s Disease: While this is a condition of copper accumulation, the body's inability to effectively excrete copper can
lead to a functional copper deficiency, where copper is not available for essential metabolic functions.

9. Rare Genetic Disorders: Apart from Menkes disease, other rare genetic conditions can impact copper metabolism and
utilization.

10. Excessive Intake of lron Supplements: High levels of iron can compete with copper for absorption in the intestines,
potentially leading to reduced copper levels.","While pure copper deficiency is rare, when it does occur, it can be associated with:
1. Malabsorption Syndromes: Conditions like celiac disease can hinder the body’s ability to absorb copper.
2. Excessive Zinc Intake: Large amounts of zinc can inhibit the absorption of copper.
3. Menkes Disease: A rare genetic disorder that affects copper levels in the body.
4. Prolonged Parenteral Nutrition: People who receive nutrition intravenously for extended periods can develop copper
deficiency if their solution does not contain adequate amounts of the mineral.
5. Gastric Bypass Surgery: This can affect copper absorption in some individuals.","Here are some recommendations for treating copper deficiency:
1. Dietary Adjustments:
° Increase Intake of Copper-rich Foods: Some of the best dietary sources of copper include:
s Liver (chicken or beef)
s Seafood (especially shellfish like oysters and crab)
s Nuts (especiaily almonds and pecans)
= Seeds (such as sunflower seeds)
s Whole grains (like whole wheat bread and oats)
s Legumes (like lentils and chickpeas)
s Dark green leafy vegetables (like spinach and kale)
s Fruits like avocados and oranges
s Vegetables such as mushrooms, broccoli, radishes, and garlic
» Molasses
oe Limit High Fructose Foods: Excessive intake of fructose, commonly found in some sweeteners and processed
foods, might interfere with copper metabolism, so it’s advisable to moderate consumption.

2. Supplements:
° Dosage: Copper supplementation is typically recommended at doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg/day, depending on
the severity of the deficiency and individual needs.\
° Caution: While it’s crucial to address a deficiency, excessive copper intake can be harmful. Chronic high doses can
lead to copper toxicity, which can manifest as gastrointestinal distress, liver damage, or neurological problems.
Always consult with a healthcare provider before beginning any supplementation.
3. Drug and Nutrient Interactions:
© Zinc: High levels of zinc can interfere with copper absorption. If taking zinc supplements, monitor copper levels
and consider adjusting the dosage or timing of intake.
° lron: High doses of iron supplements might also affect copper absorption. Individuals taking iron supplements
should be aware of this potential interaction.
o Vitamin C: In very high doses, vitamin C might alter copper metabolism. However, this is usually only a concern at
significantly elevated vitamin C intake levels.
4. Monitor and Review:
o Regular monitoring of copper levels, especially when on supplements, ensures that the deficiency is corrected
without reaching toxic levels.
o Be aware of symptoms of both deficiency and toxicity. If any new or unusual symptoms arise, seek medical advice.
5. Address Underlying Causes:
° If the deficiency is due to an underlying condition, such as malabsorption syndromes or excessive zinc intake,
addressing that root cause will be essential in effectively treating and preventing a recurrence of copper
deficiency."
DHEA Need,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an endogenous steroid hormone produced primarily by the adrenal glands, with smaller

Endothelial Dysfunction,"Endothelial dysfunction is a term that describes the functional and structural damage that occurs to the inner lining of the
arteries, the endothelium or endothelial lining. This damage is the first step on the road to full-blown atherosclerosis, the cause
of most heart attacks and strokes. The endothelium protects the smooth muscle, found in the middle of the artery, from toxic
metabolites in the blood that can cause damage to the smooth muscle cells. When toxic metabolites, such as homocysteine,
free radicals, chlorine, environmental pollutants, free radicals and smoking, attack the smooth muscle cells the process of
atherosclerorsis is initiated. Functional Medicine aims to address the underlying causes of endothelial dysfunction to restore

Heavy Metals,"Heavy metal toxicity occurs when high levels of metals accumulate in the body, leading to adverse health effects. Metals such
as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and aluminum can interfere with normal biological processes and are toxic at high
concentrations. Exposure can occur through the environment, occupational hazards, food, water, and use of certain products
or medical treatments. Functional Medicine approaches heavy metal toxicity by identifying sources of exposure, supporting
the body's detoxification pathways, and using specific interventions to remove metals safely while minimizing their harmful
impacts.

e Lead: Lead is a heavy metal that slowly accumulates in the body. Exposure can come from contaminated drinking water,
food, work-related contact (lead based solder, ore smelters, pottery glazes etc.), lead-based paints, tobacco smoke, and
air pollution. The average daily intake of lead is roughly 200 mcg with the majority not being absorbed. The body seems
to be able to eliminate lead from the body in feces, urine and sweat. As exposure increases these mechanisms become
less able to handle the excretion of lead.

Lead interacts with other toxins in the body especially mercury and destroys the CNS and cardiovascular system. It also
blocks the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen leading to tissue hypoxia.

e Cadmium: Cadmium accumulates from seafood, which concentrates cadmium from the industrial pollution that
contaminates our rivers. Cadmium is found in our food that is grown using fertilizers that are rich in cadmium.

Cadmium exposure most commonly comes from the air from the burning of fossil fuels, car tires (cadmium is released
from car tires), and auto exhaust. Many workers are exposed to cadmium in the workplace e.g. glass makers, auto
mechanics, people working in print shops. The average daily cadmium intake is 30 mcg and we have a very difficult time
getting rid of it! Cadmium causes the greatest damage in the normal cell division process in the cell.

e Arsenic: Arsenic enters the environment in tobacco smoke, pressure treated lumber, paints, dental preparations. The
daily intake of arsenic is 50 mcg. The majority of it comes from our food because of the pesticides used on the majority
of the crops used in food preparation. Arsenic is implicated in causing heart, blood vessel, and neurological diseases. It
can also cause the bone marrow to shut down and trigger cancer.

e Aluminum: Aluminum is the most abundant mineral in the earth's crust. In the earth it is tightly bound and virtually inert,
however in its processed form it causes damage the DNA and RNA in the celt. Aluminum is ubiquitous in our
environment being found in everything from kitchen foil to cooking pots and cans. Aluminum in these products is
liberated into the food and liquids we consume and enters into our bodies. Aluminum is also found in antiperspirants,
antacids, and baking powders. Advice your patients not to cook with aluminum cookware or aluminum foil. The body
does not have an adequate way of getting rid of aluminum. It has a tendency to be stored inside the extracellular matrix
of our tissues where it can cause damage. Aluminum is especially attracted to phosphate molecules in the body
especially the DNA and RNA. High levels of aluminum in the body can cause changes to the neurons in the brain, which
are called neurofibrillary tangles. This is particularly common in Alzheimer’s disease.

e Mercury: Mercury is a major toxin in the atmosphere. It is produced from coal fired power stations and pesticides. One of
the major sources of mercury toxicity comes from within the body through the amalgam fillings many of your patients
have in their mouths. Amalgam filings are 50% mercury and every bite of food releases a minute amount of mercury into
the blood stream. This can accumulate in the body leading to damage to various systems of the body. Metallic mercury
in the teeth becomes a substance called methyl-mercury, which readily passes through physiological barriers such as the
cell membranes and the brain where it accumulates. In fact the principal target of methyl-mercury is the brain.","« Fatigue

e Bone disorders: Metals like lead can displace calcium in bones. Immune disorders: Including increased risk of
autoimmune diseases.
Patients with the following diagnoses should be checked for mercury toxicity:
e Lichen planus
e Multiple sclerosis
e Hypertension
« Dementia
e Headaches/migraines
e Renal diseases including glomerulonephritis
e Hormone dysfunction
e Neurological diseases
e Peripheral neuropathy
« Auto-immune diseases

Here are some of the diseases associated with cadmium toxicity:
e Hypertension: It bio-accumulates in the kidneys where it can lead to hypertension,
e Arterial Disease: It triggers arterial disease and is associated with ringing in the ears,
e Osteoporosis: It interferes with calcium absorption
e Anemia: Causes an anemia that has “no apparent cause”,
e Prostate Issues: Lastly it is strongly connected with BPH, prostatitis, and is a potent cause of prostate cancer","Functional Medicine strategies for working with heavy metal toxicity include:

e Identifying and removing sources of exposure: Crucial to prevent further accumulation.

e Supporting detoxification: Enhancing liver and kidney function through diet, hydration, and supplementation (e.g., milk
thistle, N-acetylcysteine).

e Nutritional support: A diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals to support the body’s natural detoxification
processes. Specific nutrients like zinc, selenium, and magnesium can help displace heavy metals from the body.

e Supplementation: To correct deficiencies and support detoxification, Vitamins C and E, alpha-lipoic acid, and
glutathione are potent antioxidants that can help reduce oxidative stress from metals. Arginine chelates nickel, copper,
cobalt, zinc and iron. Glycine chelates aluminum, nickel and mercury.

e Botanical medicines: Chlorophyll, Garlic, Chlorella pyrendeidosa, and Cilantro are all botanical chelating agents that bind
and chelate heavy metals in the body. Chlorella has the advantage of inhibiting bowel re-absorption of toxic metals.
Cilantro has the advantages of mobilizing metals from the brain, detoxifying xenobiotics, and providing immune support
(antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-tumor properties). Botanicals are not as harsh or expensive as DMSA or EDTA but are
typically not as effective. They can be used on their own or as an adjunctive therapy with the oral chelating agents
discussed above. It depends on the tolerance of your patient and the speed that you want to get rid of the toxic metals.
Note: spirulina & blue-green algae are not proven to chelate metals and may contain neurotoxins & mercury. Be sure of
the sources you are recommending.

e Chelation therapy involves using specific agents (e.g., DMSA, EDTA) to bind metals and facilitate their excretion. Due
to potential side effects and the risk of mineral depletion, this should be conducted under close medical supervision.

e Gut health optimization: Supporting the gut microbiome can enhance detoxification and reduce the absorption of
metals.

e Lifestyle modifications: Adequate sleep, stress reduction, and physical activity can support overall health and resilience.
Management should be highly personalized, taking into account the type and severity of metal exposure, individual health
status, and specific needs. Regular monitoring through diagnostic testing is essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment
interventions and to adjust the pian as needed, ensuring safe and effective detoxification."
Helicobacter Pylori,"Helicobacter pylori is a type of bacteria that infects the stomach lining, often persisting for years without symptoms. When
symptoms do occur, they can lead to conditions such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, and can increase the risk for gastric cancer.

* Crohn's Disease
* Rosacea","Functional Medicine strategies for managing H. pylori infections focus on:
e Eradication therapy: Using a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPls) as the first-line treatment.
The choice of antibiotics may be influenced by local antibiotic resistance patterns but here’s a common protocol:
e Use at least 2 antibiotics
o Use at least one “luminal agent”:
= Tetracycline
= Penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin
* Bismuth
o Use at least one different systemic agent:
© Penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin
° Metronizadole
° Erythromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin
° Tetracycline
¢ Bismuth
© The call nowadays is for an acid-blocking drug, usually a proton pump inhibitor.
© The antibiotics hetp destroy the bacteria, and the proton pump inhibitor relieves pain and nausea, “heals”
inflammation and may increase the antibiotics’ effectiveness.

° To ensure that H. pylori has been eliminated you must test again after treatment.
© Note: If you choose this route use probiotics during and after treatment

e Supplementation: Probiotics may reduce side effects of antibiotic treatment and help restore gut microbiome balance.
Supplements like zinc-carnosine, mastic gum, vitamin C, and deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) can support the healing
of the stomach lining.

e Dietary modifications: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber may help protect the stomach lining and support overall
gut health. Foods containing natural antibacterial properties, such as cranberries, garlic, and broccoli sprouts, may also
be beneficial.

e Manage stress and lifestyle factors: Stress reduction techniques and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol can
support treatment and reduce the risk of complications.

e Treat the underlying hypochlorhydria: Most patients who have hypochlorhydria and H. pylori will continue to experience
symptoms and problems, even if the antibiotic or natural treatment for H. pylori has eradicated the bacteria. You must
also assess and treat for both hypochlorhydria and gastric inflammation.

Management should be personalized, considering the individual's syrnptoms, lifestyle, and response to treatment. Regular
monitoring and follow-up tests are crucial to confirm the eradication of H. pylori and assess the healing of the stomach lining.
Addressing H. pylori infections effectively requires an integrative approach, focusing not only on eradicating the bacteria but
also on healing the gut, supporting the body's natural defenses, and making sustainable lifestyle and dietary changes to
prevent recurrence."
Hydration Status,"Hydration status is crucial for maintaining health and optimal physiological function. Both dehydration and overhydration
(hypervolemia) can lead to significant health issues. Dehydration occurs when fluid intake is insufficient to replace free water

e Optimizing nutrient intake: lodine, selenium, zinc, and vitamin D are essential for thyroid function and hormone
synthesis.

e Gluten-free diet: Especially in cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as gluten sensitivity may exacerbate autoimmune
reactions.

e Stress management: Chronic stress can impair thyroid function; practices such as meditation, yoga, and adequate sleep
can be beneficial.

e Gut health: Addressing gut dysbiosis and enhancing gut health through probiotics, fermented foods, and fiber can
support overall immune regulation.

e Detoxification support: Reducing exposure to environmental toxins and supporting liver detoxification pathways can
improve thyroid health.

e Thyroid hormone replacement therapy: Synthetic levothyroxine (T4) is the standard treatment to normalize thyroid
hormone levels. Some patients may benefit from combined T3 and T4 therapy, but this should be personalized and
closely monitored.

e Supplements: For patients with primary hypothyroidism, certain supplements may be beneficial alongside traditional
thyroid hormone replacement therapy, such as levothyroxine. These supplements can help support overall thyroid
function and address nutrient deficiencies that often co-occur with thyroid disorders. However, it’s crucial to consult
with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement, especially to avoid interactions with thyroid medications and
to tailor the supplementation to the individual's specific needs. Here are some supplements commonly considered for
individuals with primary hypothyroidism:

© Selenium: Supports thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism. Selenium also has antioxidant properties that can
help reduce thyroid antibody levels in autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease).

eo Zine: Plays a role in thyroid hormone synthesis and can help support thyroid function. Zinc deficiency has been
linked to hypothyroidism.

© Iron: Iron deficiency can impair thyroid hormone synthesis. Supplementing with iron should be considered if tests
confirm an iron deficiency.

o Vitamin D: Low levels of vitamin D are common in individuals with autoimmune thyroid diseases such as
Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vitamin D supplementation may help modulate the immune response.

° lodine: lodine is crucial for thyroid hormone production. However, iodine supplementation should be approached
with caution, as both too little and too much iodine can exacerbate thyroid dysfunction. Supplementation is
generally not recommended unless a deficiency is identified, especially in areas where iodine is already added to
table salt and food.

o Magnesium: Important for general health and has been shown to support thyroid function. Magnesium can also
aid in the conversion of T4 to the more active T3 hormone.

© Omega-3 fatty acids: Found in fish oil supplements, they can help reduce inflammation and support immune
function, potentially beneficial for those with autoimmune thyroid disease.

o L-Tyrosine: An amino acid used in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Supplementation may support thyroid
function, but it should be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider, as it can affect thyroid hormone
levels.

© It's important to note that supplements are not a replacement for traditional thyroid hormone replacement
therapy in those with primary hypothyroidism but can be used as adjunctive support. The timing of
supplementation is also important, as certain supplements (like iron and calcium) can interfere with the
absorption of thyroid medication if taken too closely together. Always advise patients to take supplements a few
hours apart from their thyroid medication

Management should be personalized, considering the patient’s symptoms, lifestyle, and underlying causes. Collaboration with
an endocrinologist may be needed for complex cases. Regular monitoring of thyroid function tests, symptoms, and lifestyle
modifications is essential to adjust the treatment plan effectively and support the patient's overall health and well-being."

Parathyroid Hyperfunction,"Parathyroid hyperfunction, or hyperparathyroidism, occurs when one or more of the parathyroid glands produce too much
parathyroid hormone (PTH). This excess PTH causes an increase in blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) by increasing calcium
release from bones, enhancing calcium absorption in the intestines, and reducing calcium excretion in the urine.
Hyperparathyroidism can be primary, secondary, or tertiary, with primary hyperparathyroidism being the most common, often
due to a benign tumor (adenoma) on a parathyroid gland. Functional Medicine approaches hyperparathyroidism by aiming to
correct calcium and phosphorus imbalances, support bone health, and address the underlying causes through diet, lifestyle,

1. Inefficient formation of ATP- an uncoupling of the Kreb's cycle from the oxidative phosphorylation system, caused by
increasing oxidative stress, will lead to the creation and formation of organic acid metabolites in the cell.
2. The incomplete digestion/oxidation of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates due to diminished or depleted enzymes or
stomach acid will lead to the build-up of organic acids.
3. Increasing kidney stress. Kidneys fail to process and eliminate H+.
4. Anaerobic respiration causes a production of lactic and pyruvic acids due to a general lack of oxygenation through poor
breathing techniques.
5. Renal loss of bicarbonate, sodium, and potassium
6. Stress- excess stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system creates increased cellular metabolism and concentrations
of acidic metabolites.
7. A deficiency in vitamins and minerals used as buffers by the body
8. Lack of exercise: The body fails to clean and filter lymph
9. Liver dysfunction leads to failure of the liver-dependent urea cycle to flush out acids

Causes of Metabolic Alkalosis
1. Use of diuretics- Cause water, cation, and chloride depletion while bicarbonate is retained. Loss of H+, K+, and Mg+
exceeds loss of sodium.
2. Loss of acid- loss of gastric fluid (Excessive vomiting), poor urinary retention of H+
3. Chloride depletion- adrenal fatigue, loss of gastric juice, poor retention of Cl-
4. Excess secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex causes a large amount of sodium to be reabsorbed and urinary
loss of H+, Cl-, and K+ ions.

Prostate Function,"Prostate dysfunction encompasses several conditions affecting the prostate gland, a walnut-sized gland in men that produces
seminal fluid. Common prostate disorders include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis cinflammation of the
prostate), and prostate cancer. These conditions can lead to urinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and, in the case of cancer,
serious health outcomes. Functional Medicine approaches focus on identifying and addressing underlying causes and risk
factors to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

Congestion or obstruction in the urinary tract will cause a back-up into the kidneys, impacting normai renal function. This can
lead to an accumulation of creatinine in the blood and may indicate a chronic inflammatory, infectious, or obstructive process
(i.e., BPH, prostatitis, chronic UTIs).","« Difficulty starting urination

Secondary Hypothyroidism,"Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when there is significant anterior pituitary dysfunction affecting the production of thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH). This results in inadequate stimulation of the thyroid gland, leading to low thyroid hormone levels
despite a normally functioning thyroid. Unlike primary hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland itself is dysfunctional,
secondary hypothyroidism results from inadequate stimulation by TSH due to pituitary gland issues. This condition requires a
comprehensive approach to address both the thyroid hormone deficiency and the underlying pituitary dysfunction.","« Fatigue and weakness

e Dietary changes: Emphasize whole, nutrient-dense foods tailored to correct specific deficiencies. Include sources rich in
the deficient vitamin(s) and consider dietary patterns that support overall health.
e Supplementation: Prescribe specific vitamin supplements to address deficiencies, under medical supervision to avoid
toxicity, especially with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).
e Gut health: Support absorption by addressing gut health issues with probiotics, digestive enzymes, and gut-healing
nutrients.
e Lifestyle adjustments: Encourage adequate sunlight exposure for vitamin D synthesis, reduce alcohol consumption and
smoking, and promote physical activity.
e Monitoring and adjustment: Regularly monitor vitamin levels and symptoms to adjust dietary, lifestyle, and
supplementation strategies as needed.
Treatment plans should be individualized, considering the patient's overall health, dietary preferences, lifestyle, and specific
vitamin imbalances. Regular follow-up is essential to ensure the effectiveness of interventions and prevent potential
complications associated with vitamin imbalances."
Zinc Need,"Zinc is a vital trace mineral essential for numerous aspects of health, including immune function, wound healing, DNA
synthesis, and cell division. it plays a crucial role in enzymatic reactions, protein synthesis, and the function of over 300
enzymes in the human body. Zinc is also fundamental in the development and function of immune cells, wound healing, taste
perception, and the maintenance of skin integrity. Zinc deficiency can lead to a wide range of health issues, affecting almost
every aspect of the body's systems. Despite its critical roles, the body does not have a specialized zinc storage system, making
regular intake vital.","« Weak immune response: Leading to frequent infections.
« Poor wound healing
« Skin conditions: Such as eczema, acne, and psoriasis.
« Hair loss
« Changes in taste or smell
« Growth retardation in children
« Mood swings and cognitive dysfunction
« Delayed sexual maturation
« White spots on nails
« Reduced sense of smell or taste
« Cuts are slow to heal
« Acne
« BPH","Symptoms of zinc deficiency are varied and can include:
¢ Weak immune response: Leading to frequent infections.
* Poor wound healing
¢ Skin conditions: Such as eczema, acne, and psoriasis.
« Hair loss
e Changes in taste or smell
+ Growth retardation in children
* Mood swings and cognitive dysfunction
« Delayed sexual maturation
¢ White spots on nails
« Reduced sense of smell or taste
« Cuts are slow to heal
« Acne
¢ BPH","Assessing zinc deficiency involves:
e Plasma or serum zinc level testing: The most commonly used method, though it may not always reflect celiular zinc
status accurately.
e Alkaline phosphatase activity can be reduced in zinc deficiency, as zinc is a cofactor for this enzyme.
e Zinc protoporphyrin levels in red blood cells can increase when cellular zinc is deficient.
e Hair and urine zinc analysis: Can provide additional information.
e Dietary assessment: To evaluate potential dietary causes of deficiency.","Zinc deficiency can result from various factors:

e Inadequate dietary intake: Common in vegetarian or low-protein diets, as the best zinc sources are typically animal
products.

e Malabsorption syndromes: Conditions like Crohn's disease, celiac disease, or short bowel syndrome can impair zinc
absorption.

e Increased requirements: Pregnancy, lactation, and periods of rapid growth (such as childhood and adolescence)
increase the body's zinc needs.

e Chronic diseases: Liver disease, renal disease, sickle cell disease, and diabetes can affect zinc status.

e Medications: Some drugs, including diuretics and ACE inhibitors, can increase zinc excretion.","Zinc deficiency can contribute to or exacerbate various conditions:
e Immune system disorders: Increased susceptibility to infection and possibly autoimmune diseases.
e Dermatological issues: Poor skin health and wound healing.
e Reproductive health issues: Including impaired fertility and complications in pregnancy.
e Growth impairment: In children and adolescents.
e Neurological functions: Impacting mood, learning, and memory.","Functional Medicine approaches to managing zinc deficiency focus on dietary modification, supplementation, and addressing
underlying health issues:

e Dietary changes: Increase foods high in bioavailable zinc, including oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, and whole
grains. For vegetarians or those with high phytate diets, strategies to improve zinc absorption, such as soaking grains
and legumes, can be beneficial.

e Zinc supplementation: Oral zinc supplements can quickly correct deficiencies. The form of zinc (e.g., zinc gluconate,
zinc sulfate, zinc citrate) may influence absorption and tolerance.

e Address gastrointestinal issues: For individuals with malabsorption, treating the underlying condition is critical to
improving zinc status.

e Monitor and adjust: Regular monitoring of zinc levels and symptoms to adjust dietary and supplementation strategies as
needed. Excessive zinc supplementation can lead to copper deficiency and other health issues, so balance is key.

Management of zinc deficiency should be individualized, considering the patient’s dietary habits, lifestyle, and underlying
health conditions. Regular follow-up is essential to ensure the effectiveness of interventions and to prevent potential
complications associated with zinc deficiency or excessive supplementation."
